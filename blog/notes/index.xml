      <description>Indexing it is like collection name in databse
Index-level shard allocation filtering Index-level shard allocation filtering in Elasticsearch is a feature that allows you to control which nodes in your Elasticsearch cluster are eligible to store the primary and replica shards of specific indices. This feature gives you fine-grained control over shard placement based on node attributes and conditions, helping you optimize data distribution, resource utilization, and cluster stability.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an explanation of index-level shard allocation filtering:</description>

Crational Design pattern Once upon a time in the colorful land of Toyland, there were magical creatures known as Creators. Each Creator had a unique way of bringing toys to life, showcasing various creational design patterns.
Abstract Factory Pattern: The Artisan Workshop
In the heart of Toyland, there was an Artisan Workshop where the master toymaker, the Abstract Artisan, crafted a variety of toys.</description>

      <description>The Nature of Complexity Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software systemthat makes it hard to understand and modify the system.
Symptoms of complexity Change amplification: The first symptom of complexity is that a seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places. Cognitive load: how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task Unknown unknowns: it is not obvious which pieces of code must be modified to complete a task, or whatinformation a developer must have to carry out the task successfully Strategic vs.</description>

      <description>File system Android devices typically have a partitioned storage system, where the storage is divided into different partitions, each serving a specific purpose.
/system: This directory contains the Android operating system and system applications. It is read-only to ensure the integrity of the system. Modifying files in this directory could potentially harm the device.
/app: prebundled apps from Google, as well as any vendor or carrier-installed apps /bin: various daemons, as well as shell commands contain bootanimation,dalvikvm, adb, etc.</description>

      <description>Docker Engine When you install Docker, you get two major components:
Docker client →is a command-line tool used to interact with the Docker Engine, Docker daemon (sometimes called “server” or “engine”) In a default Linux installation, the client talks to the daemon via a local IPC/Unix socket at /var/run/docker.sock The Docker engine is the core software that runs and manages containers.The Docker Engine is made from many specialized tools that work together to create and run containers APIs, execution driver, runtime (create containers) , shims, containerd (to manage container lifecycle operations — start | stop | pause | rm.</description>

      <description>Storage Engines The storage engine (or database engine) is a software component of a database man‐ agement system responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing data in memory and on disk, designed to capture a persistent, long-term memory of each node.
Storage engines such as BerkeleyDB, LevelDB and its descendant RocksDB, LMDB and its descendant libmdbx, Sophia, HaloDB,
Row-Oriented Data Layout Row-oriented database management systems store data in records or rows. Their layout is quite close to the tabular data representation, where every row has the same set of fields.</description>

      <description>Questions to be asked
How will new service be deployed and upgraded how will it be consumed by the rest of the system Service registery -&amp;gt; Eureka
Where single service when new service it inform to service regis and who want to lookup it ask for service regis single point of failure we need to write code on each service Service Mesh -&amp;gt; TO solve the above problem
use side car and control tower (mange the sidecar ) no need to write a single code Service mesh typically consists of two components</description>

      <description>OSI Model The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
Application Layer (Htttp,DHCP,FMTP,Telnet,NFS) Presentation Layer (Encryption,Data format,Data compression,ASCII to Bin) Session Layer (TCP/IP socket authentication RTCP protocol) Transport Layer (Process level addressing TCP/UDP, Multiplexing,demultiplexing,segmentation,connection establishment) Network Layer (logical addressing IP , Routing, packet encapsulation) Data Link Layer (LAN,MAC,Data framing,Error detection) Physical Layer (Converting Bin to singals to transfer the data) Application Layer HTTP/HTTPS Is the protocol used to communicate with server.</description>

      <description>How Does NGINX Work? NGINX uses a predictable process model that is tuned to the available hardware resources:
The master process performs the privileged operations such as reading configuration and binding to ports, and then creates a small number of child processes (the next three types). The cache loader process runs at startup to load the disk‑based cache into memory, and then exits. It is scheduled conservatively, so its resource demands are low.</description>

using var keyword and const → to not reassign
var name string = “d” (if directly assing vaule we don’t need to mention the data type)</description>

A Kubernetes cluster contains six main components:
API server: Exposes a REST interface to all Kubernetes resources. Serves as the front end of the Kubernetes control plane. Scheduler: Places containers according to resource requirements and metrics. Makes note of Pods with no assigned node, and selects nodes for them to run on.</description>

      <description>How LinkedIn Adopted Protocol Buffers to Reduce Latency by 60% They heavly using microservice to avoid the latency between the service they go with protocol buffers Protocol buffer (Protobuf) is a data serialization format and a set of tools to exchange data. Protobuf keeps data and the metadata separate. And serializes data into binary format. Use Protobuf when: Payload is big Communication between non-JavaScript environments needed Frequent changes to the payload schema expected Scaling Slack’s Job Queue They using redis queue for all async operation they have face few issue with that such as Operational Memory Constraints in Redis, Complex Redis Connection Structure ,Worker Scalability Dependency on Redis etc Instead fully replace with kafa they go step by step.</description>

      <description>What is RabbitMQ? RabbitMQ is a popular open-source message broker that implements the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) standard.
Channel A channel is a separate communication channel within a single connection. Channels allow multiple concurrent exchanges to be executed in parallel, providing a way to separate different parts of your application.
Each channel has its own set of resources, such as queues, exchanges, and bindings, which are independent of the resources used by other channels in the same connection.</description>

      <description>MongoDB Architecture and Concepts if the write concern is set to “majority”, then the database will not complete the write operation until a majority of secondaries receive the write. We can also set the write concern to wait until all secondaries or a specific number of secondaries receive the write operation.
Oplog The primary node stores information about document changes in a collection within its local database called the Oplog. The primary will continuously attempt to apply these changes to secondary instances.</description>
