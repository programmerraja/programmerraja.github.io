API server: Exposes a REST interface to all Kubernetes resources. Serves as the front end of the Kubernetes control plane. Scheduler: Places containers according to resource requirements and metrics.

      <description>Channel a channel is a separate communication channel within a single connection. Channels allow multiple concurrent exchanges to be executed in parallel, providing a way to separate different parts of your application.
Each channel has its own set of resources, such as queues, exchanges, and bindings, which are independent of the resources used by other channels in the same connection. This allows you to manage concurrency and improve performance by isolating different parts of your application into separate channels.</description>
