We can also set the write concern to wait until all secondaries or a specific number of secondaries receive the write operation.\nOplog The primary node stores information about document changes in a collection within its local database called the Oplog. The primary will continuously attempt to apply these changes to secondary instances.\nTools of the Trade\nIn order to obtain the execution statistics, explain(“executionStats”) will fully execute the MongoDB statement concerned. This means that it may take much longer to complete than a simple explain() and place significant load on the MongoDB server.\nExcutionStats Takes more time compare to explain().\nProfiling\nProfiling information in MongoDB is stored within the system.profile collection. This collection follows a circular structure, meaning it has a fixed size. When this size is surpassed, older entries are automatically removed to accommodate new ones. The default size for system.profile is set to 1MB, but it might be advisable to consider increasing it based on your needs. To achieve this, one can halt profiling, drop the existing collection, and recreate it with an expanded size.\nAdjusting the profiling level is facilitated through the db.setProfilingLevel(level, {slowms: slowMsThreshold, sampleRate: samplingRate}) command. The level parameter can be set to:\n- 0 to disable profiling.\n- 1 to collect only queries surpassing a specified time threshold (`slowms`).\n- 2 to collect all queries indiscriminately.\n\nThe samplingRate parameter, which determines the random sampling level, is a crucial aspect. For instance, if set to 0.5, approximately half of all statements will undergo profiling, providing a representative sample.\nThis feature is instrumental in managing the trade-off between profiling accuracy and performance overhead. Adjusting these parameters enables a fine-tuned control over the profiling process, catering to specific optimization and analysis requirements.\nServer Status\nThe db.serverStatus() command is a quick and powerful way to get a lot of high-level information about your MongoDB server DOC will return all server detail example how read and updated happens and so many thing how many connections are active\nHowever, there are two problems with using db.serverStatus() in this way. Firstly,\nthese counters don’t tell us much about what’s happening on the server right now,\nmaking it difficult to identify which of the metrics may be impacting the performance of\nour application\nExamining Current Operations\nAnother useful tool when tuning performance in MongoDB is the db.currentOp()\ncommand. This command works as you might imagine – it returns information about\noperations that are currently running on the database\nIndexing\nIndex scans are not always a good thing. If the range is extensive, then the index scan might be worse than not using an index at all.\nIndex is not suitable if we going to read all docs but mongo use index u can specify to use col scan hint({$natural:1}),\nTo fully optimize an or query, index all the attributes in the or array.\nAn exists:true lookup can be optimized by a sparse index on the attribute concerned. However, such an index cannot optimize an exists:false query.\nIf you want to do case-insensitive searches, then there is a trick you can use. First, create an index with a case-insensitive collation sequence. This is done by specifying a collation sequence with a strength db.customers.createIndex({ LastName: 1 },{ collation: { locale: &#039;en&#039;, strength: 2 } });\nIndex Merges\nif we have 2 index one for a and b if search of a and b mongodb will merges the index value on search\n1  IXSCAN a_1\n2  IXSCAN b_1\n3  AND_SORTED\n4  FETCH\nThe AND_SORTED step indicates that an index intersection has been performed.\nIndex intersections for $and conditions are unusual\nBut this not efficient as compound index and very rarely this will be used this approach need to scan more doc compared to compound index\nType of index\n\n\nCompound: A compound index is simply an index comprising more than one attribute. The most significant advantage of a compound index is that it is usually more selective than a single key index. The combination of multiple attributes will point to a smaller number of documents than indexes composed of singular attributes. A compound index that contains all of the attributes contained within the find() or $match clauses will be particularly effective  createIndex({key1:1,key2:1})\n\n\nPartial:  A partial index is one which is only maintained for a subset of information createIndex({key1:{$exists:true}})\n\n\nSparse:  sparse index doesn’t include documents that don’t contain the indexed attributes. a sparse index cannot support an $exists:true search on the indexed attribute: By contrast, non-sparse indexes contain all documents in a collection, storing null values for those documents that do not contain the indexed field. createIndex( { &quot;key&quot;: 1 }, { sparse: true } )\n\n\nGeospatial Indexes: Typically need to perform searches across map data\n\n\nText Index: MongoDB uses a method called suffix stemming to build a search index. Suffix stemming involves finding a common element (prefix) at the start of each word which forms the root of a search tree. Each divergent suffix “stems” off into its own node that may stem further. This process creates a tree that can be efficiently searched from the root (the most common shared element) down to the leaf node, with the path from the root to the leaf node forming a complete word.\nFor example, suppose we have the words “finder,” “finding,” and “findable” somewhere in our documents.\nBy using suffix stemming, we could find a common root in these words of “find,” and then the suffixes stemming from this term would be “er,” “ing,” and “able.” createIndex({description: &quot;text&quot;})\n\n\nFinding Unused Indexes\nwe can take a look at index utilization by using the $indexStats aggregation command:\n{\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;test&quot;,\n&quot;key&quot;: {\n\t&quot;key&quot;: 1\n},\n&quot;host&quot;: &quot;xxx:27017&quot;,\n&quot;accesses&quot;: {\n\t&quot;ops&quot;: NumberLong(145),\n\t&quot;since&quot;: ISODate(&quot;2017-11-25T16:21:36.285Z&quot;)\n }\n}\n\nOPS :This is the number of operations that used the index\nSince : This is the time from which MongoDB gathered stats, and is typically the last start time.\n\nQuery Tuning\nOptimizing Network Round Trips\n\nProjections\nBatch Processing\nBulk Inserts\n\nBatch Processing\nWhen retrieving data using a cursor, you can specify the number of rows fetched\nin each operation using the batchSize clause. For instance, in the following we have a\ncursor where the variable batchSize controls the number of documents retrieved from\nthe MongoDB database in each network request:\ndb.millions.find({},{n:1,_id:0}).batchSize(batchsize);\nOverriding the Optimizer with Hints\nWe can change force this query to use a collection scan by adding a hint. If we\nappend .hint({$natural:1}), we instruct MongoDB to perform a collection scan to\nresolve the query:\nOptimizing Sort Operations\nBlocking sort\nThe sorting that doing without using any index is called blocking sort because the it need fetch all doc to memory and need to do sorting and return the doc to the user\nif you are going to to do a blocking sort on a large amount of data, you may need to\nallocate more memory for the sort. You can do this by adjusting the internal parameter\ninternalQueryExecMaxBlockingSortBytes.\ndb.getSiblingDB(&quot;admin&quot;).runCommand(\n{ setParameter: 1, \n internalQueryExecMaxBlockingSortBytes:1001048576 \n});\n\nHint: Beware of index-supported $ne queries. They resolve to multiple index\nrange scans which might be less effective than a collection scan.\n\nTuning AggregationPipelines\nThe method mongoTuning.aggregationExecutionStats() will provide a top-level summary of the time taken byeach step.\nvar exp = db.customers.explain(&#039;executionStats&#039;).aggregate(query)\nmongoTuning.aggregationExecutionStats(exp)\nOptimizing Aggregation Ordering\nMongoDB will automatically resequence the order of operations in a pipeline to optimize performance. one such case where automatic reordering is not possible is aggregations using $lookup. The $lookup stage allows you to join two collections\nAutomatic Pipeline Optimizations\n\nsort and limit stages will be merged, allowing the $sort to only maintain the limited number of documents instead of its entire input.\nIf your aggregation only requires a subset of document attributes,MongoDB may add a projection to remove all unused fields.when we use group mongodb will add projection before the group stage\n\nIndexed Aggregation Sorts\n\n$sort can be utilized the index only if it in early enough the pipeline to be rolled into the initial data access operation.\n\naggregate([\n{ $sort:{  d:1 }},\n{$addFields:{x:0}}\n],\n{allowDiskUse: true}\n);\n\nThe above query will use the index but if we swap the order it won’t use index because When MongoDB executes $addFields, it applies the specified expression to each document in the aggregation pipeline, introducing a modification to the document structure. This modification, in turn, may invalidate certain optimization opportunities associated with the index.\nWhen we first add the fields to the doc and if we do sorting we cannot use index because the when we index lookup and sort it we again need lookup on disk to get the document which will not have the newly added field.\n\nInserts, Updates, and Deletes\nIndexes always add to the overhead of insert and delete statements and may add to the overhead of update statements. Avoid over-indexing, especially on columns which are frequently updated.\nWrite Concern (waiting for replicas to write/update happen):  Adjusting writeConcern can improve performance, but it may come at the expense of data integrity or safety. Don’t adjust writeConcern to improve performance unless you are fully aware of these trade-offs.\nMongoDB 4.2, we have the ability to embed aggregation framework pipelines within an update statement. These pipelines allow us to set a value that is derived from, or dependent on, other values in the document. For instance, we could populate the viewCount attribute with this single query\ndb.collection.update({},[{ $set: { viewCount: { $size: &#039;$views&#039; } } }])\nServer Monitoring\n\nHost-Level Monitoring\n\nTop, uptime,vmstat,netstat,etc..\n\n\nNetwork\n\nbwn-ng → You can monitor the amount of data transferring\ntraceroute mongors03.koreacentral.cloudapp.azure.com —port=27017 -T → to find how many miilisec it take to reach  make sure it is less then 100ms\n\n\nMemory\n\nvmstat -s : print active, inactive ,swap memory etc..\niostat : for I/O\n\n\n\nMemory Tuning\nMongoDB memory architecture\nIt uses WiredTiger storage engine.Each connection uses up to 1 megabyte of RAM.By default, WiredTiger uses Snappy block compression for all collections and prefix compression for all indexes and  we can have up to 100 open connections in the pool\nThe WiredTiger storage engine maintains lists of empty records in data files as it deletes documents. This space can be reused by WiredTiger, but will not be returned to the operating system unless under very specific circumstances.\nThe amount of empty space available for reuse by WiredTiger is reflected in the output of db.collection.stats() under the heading wiredTiger.block-manager.file bytes available for reuse.\nTo allow the WiredTiger storage engine to release this empty space to the operating system, you can de-fragment your data file. This can be achieved using the compact command. For more information on its behavior and other considerations, see compact.“\nThe db.serverStatus() command provides details of how much memory MongoDB is using. The following script prints out a top-level summary of memory utilization.\nlet serverStats = db.serverStatus();\nprint(&#039;Mongod virtual memory &#039;, serverStats.mem.virtual);\nprint(&#039;Mongod resident memory&#039;, serverStats.mem.resident);\nprint(&#039;WiredTiger cache size&#039;,\n...     Math.round(\n...       serverStats.wiredTiger.cache\n             [&#039;bytes currently in the cache&#039;] / 1048576\n...     )\n...   );\nVirtual Memory\n\nThis value includes all memory that the MongoDB process can access, including both physical RAM and swap space.\nVirtual memory represents the total memory space allocated by the operating system to the process. It includes not only the resident memory but also any memory that may have been swapped out to disk or is reserved but not currently in use.\nVirtual memory can be much larger than physical memory, as it represents the total address space allocated to the process.\n\nResident Memory\n\nis the amount of physical RAM, in mebibytes (MiB), that the MongoDB process is currently using.\n\nNote : The Wired Tiger cache will be set to either 50% of total memory minus 1GB or to 256MB\nThe Database Cache “Hit” Ratio\nThe database cache hit ratio is a somewhat notorious metric with a long history.Simplistically, the cache hit ratio describes how often you find a block of data you want in memory:\nCacheHitRatio = Number of IO requests that were satisfied in the cache / Total IO requests\nThe cache hit ratio represents the proportion of block requests that are satisfied by the database cache without requiring a disk read. Each “hit” – when the block is found in memory – is a good thing, since it avoids a time-consuming disk IO.\nScript to calculate\nvar cache=db.serverStatus().wiredTiger.cache;\nvar missRatio=cache[&#039;pages read into cache&#039;]*100/cache[&#039;pages requested from the cache&#039;];\nvar hitRatio=100-missRatio;\nprint(hitRatio);\nIt will return the cache hit since server started.To calculate for specfic peroid of the time use mongo tunning mongoTuning.monitorServerDerived(5000,/cacheHitRate/)\nEvictions (putting data to disk from cache)\nMongoDB doesn’t wait until the cache is completely full before performing evictions.By default, MongoDB will try and keep 20% of the cache free for new data and will startto restrict new pages from coming into cache when the free percentage hits 5%\nMongoDB tries to keep the percentage of modified – “dirty” – blocks under 5%. If the percentage of modified blocks hits 20%, then operations will be blocked until the target value is achieved.\nWhen the number of clean blocks or dirty blocks hits the higher threshold values, then sessions that try to bring new blocks into the cache will be required to perform an eviction before the read operation can complete\nTo get total blocking evictions so far `db.serverStatus().wiredTiger[“thread-yield”][“page acquire eviction blocked”]\nTo get ratio\nvar wt=db.serverStatus().wiredTiger;\nvar blockingEvictRate=wt[&#039;thread-yield&#039;][&#039;page acquire eviction blocked&#039;] *100 / wt[&#039;cache&#039;][&#039;eviction server evicting pages&#039;];\n\nwiredTiger.cache(“application threads page read from disk to cache count”): This records the number of reads from disk into the Wired Tiger cache.\napplication threads page read from disk to cache time (usecs): This records the number of microseconds spent moving data from disk to cache\nIf we divide the count/time we get average time to read a page into the cache it must need between 1ms to 2ms\napplication threads page write from cache to disk count: The number of writes from the cache to disk\napplication threads page write from cache to disk time (usecs): The time spent writing from cache to disk\n\nCheckpoints\nWhen ever data updated the data won’t get updated in disk it will updated in cache first then only it will be updated bulk to disk to avoid I/O\nMongodb periodically ensures that the data files are synchronized with the changes in the cache. These checkpoints involve writing out the modified “dirty” blocks to disk. By default, checkpoints occur every 60 sec.\nThe eviction_dirty_trigger and eviction_dirty_target settings –  control how many modified blocks are allowed in the cache before eviction processing kicks in. These can be adjusted to reduce the number of modified blocks in the cache, reducing the amount of data that must be written to disk during a checkpoint.\nDisk IO\nLatency and Throughput\nLatency describes the time it takes to retrieve a single item of information from the disk\nThroughput describes the number of IOs that can be performed by the disk devices in a given unit of time. Throughput is generally expressed in terms of IO operations per second, often abbreviated as IOPS.\nTIP: The throughput of an IO system is primarily determined by the number of physical disk devices it contains. To increase IO throughput, increase the number of physical disks in disk volumes.\nMongoDB IO\nMongoDB performs three major types of IO operations:\n\n\nTemporary file IO involves reads and writes to the “_tmp” directory within the dbPath directory. These IOs occur when a disk sort or disk-­based aggregation operation occurs\n\n\nDatafile IO occurs when WiredTiger reads from and writes to collection and index files in the db Path directory\n\n\nJournal file IO  occurs as the WiredTiger storage engine writes to the“write-ahead” journal file.\n\ndb.serverStatus().wiredTiger.log\n\nlog bytes written: The amount of data written to the journal.\nlog sync operations: The number of log “sync” operations. A sync occurs when journal information held in memory is flushed to disk.\nlog sync time duration (μsecs): The number of microseconds spent in sync operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nReplica Sets\nA replica set following best practice consists of a primary node together with two or more secondary nodes. It is recommended to use three or more nodes, with an odd number of total nodes. The primary node accepts all write requests which are propagated synchronously or asynchronously to the secondary nodes. In the event of a failure of a primary, an election occurs to which a secondary node is elected to serve as the new primary and database operations can continue\nRead Preference → By default, all reads are directed to the primary node. However, we can set a read preference which directs the MongoDB drivers to direct read requests to secondary nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead PreferenceprimaryThis is the default. All reads are directed to the replica set primary.primaryPreferredDirect reads to the primary, but if no primary is available, direct reads to a secondary.secondaryDirect reads to a secondary.secondaryPreferredDirect reads to a secondary, but if no secondary is available, direct reads to the primary.nearestDirect reads to the replica set member with the lowest network round trip time to the calling program.\nmaxStalenessSeconds : can be added to a read preference to control the tolerable lag in data. When picking a secondary node, the MongoDB driver will only consider those nodes who have data within maxStalenessSeconds seconds of the primary. The minimum value is 90 seconds. For instance, this URL specified a preference for secondary nodes, but only if their data timestamps are within 5 minutes (300 seconds) of the primary:\nReplica Set Tag Sets: Tag sets can be used to direct read requests to specific nodes. You can use tag sets to nominate nodes for special purposes such as analytics or to distribute read workload more evenly across all nodes in the cluster.\nSharding\n\nwww.percona.com/blog/when-should-i-enable-mongodb-sharding/\nNeed to study :)\n"},"notes/2023/RabbitMQ":{"title":"RabbitMQ","links":["/","[https:/medium.com/@upadhyayyuvi/building-a-reliable-message-queue-system-with-rabbitmq-and-node-js-step-by-step-guide-275e026d2090](https:/medium.com/@upadhyayyuvi/building-a-reliable-message-queue-system-with-rabbitmq-and-node-js-step-by-step-guide-275e026d2090)"],"tags":[],"content":"What  is RabbitMQ?\nRabbitMQ is a popular open-source message broker that implements the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) standard.\nChannel\nA channel is a separate communication channel within a single connection. Channels allow multiple concurrent exchanges to be executed in parallel, providing a way to separate different parts of your application.\nEach channel has its own set of resources, such as queues, exchanges, and bindings, which are independent of the resources used by other channels in the same connection. This allows you to manage concurrency and improve performance by isolating different parts of your application into separate channels.\nFor example, you might create one channel for sending messages and another channel for receiving messages, or create separate channels for different types of messages or different parts of your application. By using multiple channels, you can take advantage of the scalability and performance benefits of AMQP while also making it easier to manage your application.\nChannel vs connection\nIn RabbitMQ, a connection represents a network connection to the RabbitMQ broker. When a client connects to RabbitMQ, it establishes a TCP connection to the broker. This connection remains open until the client explicitly closes it or the broker closes it due to a network error or a timeout. A connection is created using the AMQP protocol, and it is responsible for authentication, connection handling, and connection-level flow control.\nOn the other hand, a channel is a virtual connection inside a connection that allows multiple logical connections to be multiplexed over a single physical connection. When a client establishes a connection to RabbitMQ, it can create one or more channels inside that connection. Each channel is a separate AMQP session that can be used to publish or consume messages, declare queues and exchanges, and bind queues to exchanges.\nThe main difference between a connection and a channel is that a connection represents a physical connection to the broker, whereas a channel represents a logical connection within that physical connection. Channels allow multiple AMQP operations to be multiplexed over a single network connection, which can help reduce the overhead of establishing multiple network connections.\nIn summary, a connection in RabbitMQ represents a physical network connection to the broker, while a channel represents a logical connection within that physical connection, allowing multiple AMQP operations to be multiplexed over a single network connection.\nExchanges\nIn RabbitMQ, an exchange is a message routing agent that receives messages from producers and routes them to queues based on message properties such as the routing key. When a producer sends a message to an exchange, it is up to the exchange to route the message to one or more queues.\nThere are four types of exchanges in RabbitMQ:\n\n\nDirect exchange: Messages are routed to queues based on the exact match between the routing key of the message and the routing key of the queue.\n\n\nFanout exchange: Messages are routed to all the queues bound to the exchange. It ignores the routing key and sends messages to all the queues that are bound to the exchange.\n\n\nTopic exchange: Messages are routed to queues based on pattern matching between the routing key of the message and the routing key of the queue. It uses wildcards to match the routing key.\n\n\nHeaders exchange: Messages are routed to queues based on header values instead of routing keys. It is rarely used, and its functionality is similar to the topic exchange.\n\n\nx-delayed-message → is a custom exchange type in RabbitMQ that allows you to delay messages before they are delivered to a queue. This exchange type is not included in RabbitMQ by default and must be installed as a plugin.\nWhen you create an x-delayed-message exchange, you can set a delay time for messages using the x-delay header. The exchange will hold the message for the specified delay time and then deliver it to the appropriate queue. This is useful in scenarios where you want to delay the delivery of a message until a certain time or after a certain event has occurred.\n\n\nExample\nconst amqp = require(&#039;amqplib&#039;);\n \nasync function setup() {\n  // Connect to RabbitMQ\n  const connection = await amqp.connect(&#039;amqp://localhost&#039;);\n  const channel = await connection.createChannel();\n \n  // Install the delayed message exchange plugin (if necessary)\n  await channel.assertExchange(&#039;amq.delayed&#039;, &#039;x-delayed-message&#039;, {\n    durable: true,\n    arguments: {\n      &#039;x-delayed-type&#039;: &#039;direct&#039;\n    }\n  });\n \n  // Create the queue and bind it to the delayed message exchange\n  const queueName = &#039;my-queue&#039;;\n  const routingKey = &#039;my-routing-key&#039;;\n \n  await channel.assertQueue(queueName, { durable: true });\n \n  await channel.bindQueue(queueName, &#039;amq.delayed&#039;, routingKey);\n \n  // Consumer function to handle incoming messages\n  const consumerFunction = (msg) =&gt; {\n    console.log(`Received message: ${msg.content.toString()}`);\n    channel.ack(msg);\n  };\n \n  // Consume messages from the queue\n  channel.consume(queueName, consumerFunction);\n \n  // Producer function to send messages with a delay\n  const producerFunction = async (message, delayMs) =&gt; {\n    const headers = { &#039;x-delay&#039;: delayMs };\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(message);\n \n    await channel.publish(&#039;amq.delayed&#039;, routingKey, buffer, { headers });\n \n    console.log(`Sent message &quot;${message}&quot; with delay of ${delayMs}ms`);\n  };\n \n  // Send some messages with a delay\n  await producerFunction(&#039;Hello World!&#039;, 5000);\n  await producerFunction(&#039;Delayed message!&#039;, 10000);\n}\n \nsetup();\nApplication of Exchange\nLet’s say you have a distributed system that consists of multiple microservices. Each microservice has its own queue, and they communicate with each other through messaging.\nWhen a microservice wants to send a message to another microservice, it can publish the message to an exchange instead of directly sending it to the other microservice’s queue. The exchange is responsible for routing the message to the appropriate queue based on the message’s routing key.\nFor example, let’s say you have a microservice that handles user authentication, and another microservice that handles user orders. When a user logs in, the authentication microservice can publish a message to the exchange with a routing key of “user.login”. The exchange can then route this message to the order microservice’s queue, which is bound to the exchange with a matching routing key.\nIf you didn’t use an exchange, the authentication microservice would have to know the exact name of the order microservice’s queue and send the message directly to that queue. This would tightly couple the microservices and make it harder to make changes to the system in the future.\nBy using an exchange, you can create a loosely coupled system where microservices don’t need to know about each other’s queues. This makes it easier to add new microservices or change the routing rules of messages without affecting other parts of the system.\nDurablity\nRabbitMQ provides durability by persisting messages and metadata to disk. This ensures that messages are not lost in case of a server failure.if it durable to true it will presist if we set false it will not until it reach threshold\nPrefetch\nRabbitMQ uses prefetch to control the amount of messages a consumer can consume at once. Prefetch specifies the number of unacknowledged messages that can be in-flight before the broker stops delivering more messages to the consumer. This avoids overloading a consumer with too many messages at once.\nAmqp-connection-manager vs Amqplib\namqp-connection-manager and amqplib are both Node.js libraries for working with RabbitMQ, but they have different purposes and use cases.\namqplib is a low-level RabbitMQ client library that provides a thin wrapper around the RabbitMQ API. It allows you to send and receive messages, create and manage exchanges and queues, and interact with other RabbitMQ features. amqplib provides a direct and flexible interface to RabbitMQ, and is a good choice if you need complete control over your RabbitMQ interactions.\namqp-connection-manager, on the other hand, is a higher-level library that provides connection management and channel pooling. It uses amqplib under the hood, but adds features like connection retry, connection throttling, and automatic channel recovery. amqp-connection-manager is a good choice if you want to simplify your RabbitMQ code and reduce the chance of connection errors, or if you need to handle multiple connections and channels.\nIn general, if you need fine-grained control over your RabbitMQ interactions, or if you have a small number of connections and channels, amqplib is a good choice. If you have a large number of connections and channels, or if you want to simplify your RabbitMQ code and reduce the chance of connection errors, amqp-connection-manager is a better choice.\nWhat are the best practice regarding channel and connection\n\nUse a single connection per application instance: It’s a good practice to use a single connection for an entire application instance. Creating multiple connections can lead to resource wastage, and can make it difficult to manage and monitor connections.\nUse a connection pool: Creating and closing connections can be expensive, so it’s recommended to use a connection pool. Connection pools can be used to manage the number of connections and can help improve performance.\nUse a separate channel for each thread: When creating a multithreaded application, use a separate channel for each thread instead of sharing a single channel. Sharing a single channel between threads can lead to contention issues and can cause the application to become unstable.\nClose channels when they’re no longer needed: It’s a good practice to close channels when they’re no longer needed. This helps to reduce the number of open channels and frees up resources.\nUse a lightweight protocol: RabbitMQ provides AMQP, which is a lightweight protocol that is designed for message queuing. Using a lightweight protocol can help improve performance and reduce the overhead of managing connections and channels.\nUse transactional channels: When sending multiple messages, it’s a good practice to use transactional channels. This ensures that all messages are either sent successfully or not sent at all.\nUse a connection heartbeat: RabbitMQ provides a connection heartbeat mechanism that can be used to detect network failures. It’s a good practice to use connection heartbeat to ensure that the application can recover from network failures.\nUse connection and channel events: RabbitMQ provides connection and channel events that can be used to monitor and manage connections and channels. Using these events can help improve the reliability and performance of the application.\n\nHow to Handle failures\nIf we want to retry if the consumer get failed when processing the data we can have 2 way\n1. nack\n2. reject\nDifference between them\nThe main difference between nack (negative acknowledgement) and reject in RabbitMQ is how they handle message rejection and requeuing:\n\nnack (channel.nack):\n\nnack is used to negatively acknowledge a message and reject it.\nIt allows you to control whether the message should be requeued or discarded.\nThe method signature is channel.nack(message, allUpTo, requeue).\nThe message parameter represents the message being rejected.\nThe allUpTo parameter is a boolean that indicates whether all unacknowledged messages prior to the given message should also be rejected.\nThe requeue parameter is a boolean that determines whether the rejected message should be requeued or discarded.\nWith channel.nack, you have more control over requeuing behavior and can choose whether to discard the message or requeue it for retry.\n\n\nreject (channel.reject):\n\nreject is used to reject a message without acknowledging it.\nWhen a message is rejected using reject, it can optionally be requeued based on the requeue parameter.\nThe method signature is channel.reject(message, requeue).\nThe message parameter represents the message being rejected.\nThe requeue parameter is a boolean that determines whether the rejected message should be requeued or discarded.\nBy default, if requeue is set to true, the message will be requeued for future delivery. If set to false, the message will be discarded.\n\n\n\nIn summary, nack provides more flexibility by allowing you to explicitly control requeuing behavior (requeue or discard), whereas reject gives you the option to requeue the message based on the requeue parameter. Both methods can be used to handle message rejection and retry scenarios in RabbitMQ, depending on your specific requirements.\nRabbitmq simulator tool to playaround with it\nUnack msg\nIn RabbitMQ, messages are marked as unacknowledged (unack) when a consumer receives a message but hasn’t sent an acknowledgment back to RabbitMQ yet. Unacknowledged messages remain in the queue and are not re-delivered to other consumers until they are either acknowledged or the connection with the consumer is closed.\nInternal\nProtocol : AMQP\nBlog\n\nhow does elrang does  scheduling\n\nResources\n\nwww.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-best-practice.html\nwww.cloudamqp.com/blog/part2-rabbitmq-best-practice-for-high-performance.html\n What we learned form running 1k queue Cloudamp\n\nKeep connection and channle as low as possible\nseprate connection for pub and consume4\ndont have too large queue 10k msg\nEnable lazy queue (loaded on ram when needed)\nrabbitmq sharding\nlimited use on priroity queue\nadjust prefetch (cloudampq default 1k )\n\n\nExplain basic and how to handle error case\nwww.cloudamqp.com/blog/when-to-use-rabbitmq-or-apache-kafka.html\nyoutu.be/HzPOQsMWrGQ\n\ngithub.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins-rabbitmq"},"notes/2024/A-Philosophy-of-Software-Design-Book-Notes":{"title":"A Philosophy of Software Design Book Notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Nature of Complexity\nComplexity is anything related to the structure of a software systemthat makes it hard to understand and modify the system.\nSymptoms of complexity\n\nChange amplification: The first symptom of complexity is that a seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places.\nCognitive load: how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task\nUnknown unknowns:  it is not obvious which pieces of code must be modified to complete a task, or whatinformation a developer must have to carry out the task successfully\n\nStrategic vs. Tactical Programming\nTactical programming\nIn the tactical approach, your main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or a bug fix.\nStrategic programming\nStrategic programming requires an investment mindset. Rather than\ntaking the fastest path to finish your current project, you must invest time to\nimprove the design of the system.\nModules Should Be Deep\nA  software system is decomposed into a collection of modules that are relatively independent.\nDeep modules\nA deep module are the modules that take care of the most of things\nThe mechanism for file I/O provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface.\nThere are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures:\nint open(const char* path, int flags, mode_t permissions);\nssize_t read(int fd, void* buffer, size_t count);\nssize_t write(int fd, const void* buffer, size_t count);\noff_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int referencePosition);\nint close(int fd);\n\nThe abstraction will take care of bellow thing\n\nHow are files represented on disk in order to allow efficient access?\nHow are directories stored, and how are hierarchical path names processed to find the files they refer to?\nHow are permissions enforced, so that one user cannot modify or delete another user’s files?\nHow are file accesses implemented? For example, how is functionality divided between interrupt handlers and background code, and how do these two elements communicate safely?\nWhat scheduling policies are used when there are concurrent accesses to multiple files?\nHow can recently accessed file data be cached in memory in order to reduce the number of disk accesses?\n\nDon’t expose the thing that no need for user. try to abstract the things as much as possible\nInformation Hiding (and Leakage)\nInformation hiding\nThe basic idea is that each module should encapsulate a few pieces of knowledge, which represent design decisions. The knowledge is embedded in the module’s implementation but does not appear in its interface, so it is not visible to other modules.\nexamples of information that might be hidden within a module (it not about using private method .it is about hiding the hard implementation from user)\n\nHow to store information in a B-tree, and how to access it efficiently.\nHow to identify the physical disk block corresponding to each logical block within a file.\nHow to implement the TCP network protocol.\nHow to schedule threads on a multi-core processor.\nHow to parse JSON documents.\n\nInformation leakage\nwhen a design decision is reflected in multiple modules. This creates a dependency between the modules: any change to that design decision will require changes to all of the involved modules\nExample: Imagine a scenario in a document processing application where there are two classes: one for reading documents from various file formats and another for writing documents in those formats.\nclass DocumentReader:\n    def __init__(self, file_path):\n        # Initialization logic\n \n    def read_document(self):\n        # Read document logic\n        pass\n \n    # Other methods related to reading documents\n \n \nclass DocumentWriter:\n    def __init__(self, file_path):\n        # Initialization logic\n \n    def write_document(self, document):\n        # Write document logic\n        pass\n \n    # Other methods related to writing documents\nIn this design, both DocumentReader and DocumentWriter classes have knowledge of specific file formats. If the file format changes, both classes would need to be modified, leading to information leakage. The dependency on the file format is not explicitly part of the interface, but it exists implicitly in the implementation details.\nImproved Design to Mitigate Information Leakage:\nclass DocumentProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, file_path):\n        # Initialization logic\n \n    def read_document(self):\n        # Read document logic\n        pass\n \n    def write_document(self, document):\n        # Write document logic\n        pass\n \n    # Other methods related to document processing\nTemporal decomposition\nCommon cause for the information leakage. Consider an application that reads a file in a particular format, modifies the contents ofthe file, and then writes the file out again. With temporal decomposition, this application might be broken into three classes: one to read the file,another to perform the modifications, and a third to write out the new version. Both the file reading and file writing steps have knowledge about the file format, which results in information leakage.\nNote: When designing modules, focus on the knowledge that’s needed to perform each task, not the order in which tasks occur.\nGeneral-Purpose Modules are Deeper\nMake classes somewhat general purpose\ngeneral-purpose interface could potentially be used for other purposes besides what it supposed to do think for future how it will adpat if we want to changes.Generality leads to better information hiding\nspecial purpose interface are the inteface only for solving current specific problem it won’t for future case.\nQuestions to ask yourself\n\nWhat is the simplest interface that will cover all my current needs?\nIn how many situations will this method be used? (if it is one time then it is special purpose. try to combine multipl special purpose. in to single genral purpose)\nIs this API easy to use for my current needs?\n\nDifferent Layer, Different Abstraction\nPass-through methods\n \n// Service Layer\npublic class BusinessLogicService {\n    public void performComplexOperation(String data) {\n        // Complex business logic implementation\n        System.out.println(&quot;Performing complex operation with data: &quot; + data);\n    }\n}\n \n// Facade Layer (Pass-through layer)\npublic class FacadeLayer {\n    private BusinessLogicService businessLogicService;\n \n    public FacadeLayer() {\n        this.businessLogicService = new BusinessLogicService();\n    }\n \n    public void exposeSimilarOperation(String data) {\n        // Pass-through method\n        businessLogicService.performComplexOperation(data);\n    }\n}\n \n// Client or User Interface Layer\npublic class UserInterface {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        FacadeLayer facadeLayer = new FacadeLayer();\n        \n        // Client invokes a method on the facade layer\n        facadeLayer.exposeSimilarOperation(&quot;Some data&quot;);\n    }\n}\n \nWhile this design might be reasonable in some cases, it can lead to problems when the facade layer becomes a mere pass-through, offering little additional value. In situations like this:\n\nThe facade layer adds minimal or no logic of its own.\nThe client could potentially interact directly with the service layer, bypassing the facade layer.\n\nThis scenario might indicate a lack of clear separation of concerns or an unnecessary abstraction layer. If the facade layer doesn’t add meaningful functionality or abstraction beyond simply invoking methods from the service layer, it might be worth reconsidering the design to ensure a more effective and maintainable architecture. The goal is to have each layer in the system contribute value and have a clear purpose, rather than serving as a simple pass-through.\nPass-through variables\nVariable that is passed down through a long chain of methods.Pass-through variables add complexity because they force all of the intermediate methods to be aware of their existence, even though the methods have no use for the variables.\nSolution: use context (A context stores all of the application’s global state)\nPull Complexity Downwards\nSuppose that you are developing a new module, and you discover a piece of unavoidable complexity. Which is better: should you let users of the module deal with the complexity, or should you handle the complexity internally within the module?\nIf the complexity is related to the functionality provided by the module handle internally else the users to handle the complexity.\nExample: Avoid Configuration parameters for the module even though it give control to users but In many cases, it’s difficult or impossible for users or administrators to determine the right values for the parameters . consider network protocol where it implemented the retry logic with perodic time by analysing own\nBefore exporting a configuration parameter, ask yourself will users (or higher-level modules) be able to determine a better value than we can determine here? \nBetter Together Or Better Apart?\nIf the pieces are unrelated, they are probably better off apart. Here are a few indications that two pieces of code are related:\n\nThey share information; for example, both pieces of code might depend on the syntax of a particular type of document\nThey are used together: anyone using one of the pieces of code is likely to use the other as well and vice versa and make sure the module not used by other if it can be used by multiple it need to be sepreate.\nIt is hard to understand one of the pieces of code without looking at the other.\n\nRepetition  (RED FLAG)\nIf the same piece of code (or code that is almost the same) appears over and over again,  that’s a red flag that you haven’t found the right abstractions.\nSpecial-General Mixture  (RED FLAG)\nwhen a general-purpose mechanism also contains code specialized for a particular use of that mechanism. This makes the mechanism more complicated and creates information leakage between the mechanism and the particular use case: future modifications to the use case are likely to require changes to the underlying mechanism as well.\nSplitting and joining methods\nMethods containing hundreds of lines of code are fine if they have a simple signature and are easy to read. These methods are deep (lots of functionality, simple interface), which is good.\nIf a method has all of these properties, then it probably doesn’t matter whether it is long or not\n\nEach method should do one thing and do it completely\nThe method should have a simple interface, so that users don’t need to have much information in their heads in order to use it correctly.\nits interface should be much simpler than its implementation\n\nExample: we used to write a wrapper for loggin purpose but it just one line instead of writing that we can directly log where it needed.\nWhen spliting large function in to small function make sure the below things\n\nsomeone reading the child method doesn’t need to know anything about the parent method and vice versa. (child method is relatively general-purpose)\n\nConjoined Methods (RED FLAG)\nIt should be possible to understand each method independently. If you can’t understand the implementation of one method without also understanding the implementation of another\nDefine Errors Out Of Existence\nThe best way to eliminate exception handling complexity is to define your APIs so that there are no exceptions to handle: define errors out of existence\nExample: File Deletion in window throw error if file used by some other process. but in linux it will not it marked for deletion and wait for the process to compelete and once it done the file get removed.\nJava substring function will throw error if the index is out of range it better the function to hadle the case and return accordingly.\nMask exceptions\nReducing the number of places where exceptions must be handled is exception masking.With this approach, an exceptional condition is detected and handled at a low level in the system, so that higher levels of software need not be aware of the condition.\nExample: NFS network file system will not throw error if the NFS server crashed it will retry until it get connected or the threshold time reach.\nNOTE: Exception masking doesn’t work in all situations, but it is a powerful tool in the situations where it works.\nException aggregation\nexception aggregation is to handle many exceptions with a single piece of code; rather than writing distinct handlers for many individual exceptions, handle them all in one place with a single handler.\nDesign it Twice\nyour first thoughts about how to structure a module or system will produce the best design. You’ll end up with a much better result if you consider multiple options for each major design decision design it twice.\nWhy Write Comments? The Four Excuses\nthe process of writing comments, if done correctly, will actually improve a system’s design\n\nGood code is self-documenting\nComments get out of date and become misleading\nI don’t have time to write comments\nAll the comments I have seen are worthless\n\nComments Should Describe Things that Aren’t Obvious from the Code\nDevelopers should be able to understand the abstraction provided by a module without reading any code other than its externally visible declarations. The only way to do this is by supplementing the declarations with comments.\nhow to write good comments\n\nPick conventions\nDon’t repeat the code\nLower-level comments add precision (Some comments provide information at a lower, more detailed, level than the code; these comments add precision by clarifying the exact meaning of the code)\nHigher-level comments enhance intuition\nImplementation comments: what and why, not how\n\nChoosing Names\n\nNames should be precise\nUse names consistently\nAvoid extra words\n\nWrite The Comments First\nUse Comments As Part Of The Design Process\nModifying Existing Code\nIf you want to maintain a clean design for a system, you must take a strategic approach when modifying existing code. Ideally, when you have finished with each change, the system will have the structure it would have had if you had designed it from the start with that change in mind. To achieve this goal, you must resist the temptation to make a quick fix. Instead, think about whether the current system design is still the best one, in light of the desired change. If not, refactor the system so that you end up with the best possible design. With this approach, the system design improves with every modification.\nConsistency\nConsistency can be applied at many levels in a system; here are a few\nexamples.\n\nNames.\nCoding style\nDesign patterns\n\nEnsuring consistency\nCreate a document that lists the most important overall conventions, such as coding style guidelines. Place the document in a spot where developers are likely to see it\nDon’t change existing conventions\nResist the urge to “improve” on existing conventions. Having a “better idea” is not a sufficient excuse to introduce inconsistencies. Your new idea may indeed be better, but the value of consistency over inconsistency is almost always greater than the value of one approach over another.\nBefore introducing inconsistent behavior, ask yourself two questions\n\ndo you have significant new information justifying your approach that wasn’t available when the old convention was established\nis the new approach so much better that it is worth taking the time to update all of the old uses\n\nCode Should be Obvious\nIf code is obvious, it means that someone can read the code quickly, without much thought, and their first guesses about the behavior or meaning of the code will be correct. If code is obvious, a reader doesn’t need to spend much time or effort to gather all the information they need to work with the code.\nThings that make code less obvious\n\nEvent-driven programming\nGeneric containers\nCode that violates reader expectations\n\nSoftware Trends\n\nObject-oriented programming and inheritance\nAgile development (development should be incremental and iterative)\nUnit tests\nTest-driven development\nDesign patterns\n\nDesigning for Performance\nhave a general sense for what is expensive and what is cheap, you can use that information to choose cheap operations whenever possible\nDecide What Matters\n\nMinimize what matters\nThinking more broadly\n"},"notes/2024/AI-Agent":{"title":"AI Agent","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Multi-Agent Orchestrator\nFlexible and powerful framework for managing multiple AI agents and handling complex conversations\nRAG\nChunking Methods\n\nNaive chunking: A simple method that divides text based on a fixed number of characters, often using the CharacterTextSplitter in Langchain. It is fast and efficient but may not be the most intelligent approach as it does not account for document structure.\nSentence splitting: This method uses natural language processing (NLP) frameworks like NLTK or SpaCy to split text into sentence-sized chunks. It is more accurate than naive chunking and can handle edge cases.\nRecursive character text splitting: This method, implemented using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter in Langchain, combines character-based splitting with consideration for document structure. It recursively splits chunks based on paragraphs, sentences, and characters, maximizing the information contained within each chunk while adhering to the specified chunk size.\nStructural chunkers: Langchain provides structural chunkers for HTML and Markdown documents that split text based on the document’s schema, such as headers and subsections. This method is particularly useful for structured documents and allows for the addition of metadata to each chunk, indicating its source and location within the document.\nSemantic Chunking: This strategy uses embedding models to analyze the meaning of sentences and group together sentences that are semantically similar. It results in chunks that are more likely to represent coherent concepts, but it requires more computational resources than other methods. check out the nice article to visulize the chunking here\n\nEvaluating Chunking Strategies\nRecall is a crucial metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a chunking strategy. It measures the proportion of relevant chunks retrieved in response to a query.\nA high recall rate indicates that the chunking strategy is effectively capturing and representing the information in a way that allows for accurate retrieval.\nExample:\nImagine a document has been chunked, and a query results in three relevant chunks. The retriever returns five chunks, but only two of those are the relevant ones. In this case:\n\nRelevant elements = 3\nRetrieved elements that are also relevant = 2\nTherefore, Recall = (2/3) * 100% = 66%\n\nRetrevial types\nRank GPT\n\ninstead of just querying in vector and sending to LLM after querying ask LLM can you rank the doc that fetched from vecotr db based relvant to the query and again send to LLM with re ranked doc\n\nMulti query retrieval\n\nSend the user query to LLM and ask can you suggest revelant query to this query get that and use that query to get from db\n\nContextual compression\n\nAsk the LLM can you give relavant part that required for the doc by asking this we reducing the context then again send to LLM\n\nHypothetical document embedding\n\nask LLM to suggest Hypothetical document for query and use that to fetch from DB\n\nBM25,ADA-002\nRAG Evaluation\nRAG Triad of metrics\n\nContext Relevance → is retervied context relvant to the query?\nAnswer Relevance → is the response relvant to the query?\nGroundedness → is response supported by the context?\n\nFramework for eval trulens_eval\nRAG Fusion\nHow it works\n\n\nMulti-Query Generation: RAG-Fusion generates multiple versions of the user’s original query. As we’ve discussed above, this is different to single query generation, which traditional RAG does. This allows the system to explore different interpretations and perspectives, which significantly broadens the search’s scope and improvs the relevance of the retrieved information.\n\nUse AI to generate the multiple version of the user query\n\n\n\nReciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF): In this technique, we combine and re-rank search results based on relevance. By merging scores from various retrieval strategies, RAG-Fusion ensures that documents consistently appearing in top positions are prioritized, which makes the response more accurate.\n\n\nImproved Contextual Relevance: Because we consider multiple interpretations of the user’s query and re-ranking results, RAG-Fusion generates responses that are more closely aligned with user intent, which makes the answers more accurate and contextually relevant.\n\n\nResources\n\n Not RAG, but RAG Fusion?\ngithub.com/Raudaschl/rag-fusion\n\nCRAG\nCorrective Retrieval Augmented Generation.The strategy we followed for this let’s say for each topic, we consult the book and identify relevant sections. Before forming an opinion, categorize the gathered information into three groups: **Correct**, **Incorrect**, and **Ambiguous**. Process each type of information separately. Then, based on this processed information, compile and summarize it mentally\nHow it works\n\nRetrieval Evaluator: A lightweight model assesses the relevance of retrieved documents to the input query, assigning a confidence score to each document. This evaluator is fine-tuned on datasets with relevance signals, allowing it to distinguish relevant documents from irrelevant ones, even if they share surface-level similarities with the query.\nAction Trigger: Based on the confidence scores, CRAG triggers one of three actions:\n\nCorrect: If at least one document has a high confidence score, CRAG assumes the retrieval is correct and refines the retrieved documents to extract the most relevant knowledge strips.\n\nExample: If the query is “What is Henry Feilden’s occupation?” and a retrieved document mentions Henry Feilden’s political affiliation, CRAG would identify this as relevant and refine the document to focus on the information about his occupation.\n\n\nIncorrect: If all documents have low confidence scores, CRAG assumes the retrieval is incorrect and resorts to web search for additional knowledge sources.\n\nExample: If the query is “Who was the screenwriter for Death of a Batman?” and the retrieved documents do not contain the correct information, CRAG would initiate a web search using keywords like “Death of a Batman, screenwriter, Wikipedia” to find more reliable sources.\n\n\nAmbiguous: If the confidence scores are neither high nor low, CRAG combines both refined retrieved knowledge and web search results.\n\n\nKnowledge Refinement: For relevant documents, CRAG employs a decompose-then-recompose approach:\n\nIt breaks documents into smaller knowledge strips, filters out irrelevant strips based on their relevance scores, and then recomposes the remaining relevant strips into a concise knowledge representation.\n\n\nWeb Search: When the initial retrieval fails, CRAG utilizes web search to find complementary information.\n\nIt rewrites the input query into keyword-based search queries and prioritizes results from authoritative sources like Wikipedia to mitigate the risk of biases and unreliable information from the open web.\nThe retrieved web content is then refined using the same knowledge refinement method.\n\n\n\nCheck out implementation from langchain here\nContextual Retrieval\nContextual Retrieval is a technique that enhances the accuracy of retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base, especially when used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It addresses the limitations of traditional RAG, which often disregards context, by adding relevant context to the individual chunks of information before they are embedded and indexed. This process significantly improves the system’s ability to locate the most pertinent information.\n\nThis technique applies the BM25 ranking function, which relies on lexical matching for finding specific terms or phrases, to the contextualized chunks.\nContextual Retrieval leverages AI models like Claude to generate the contextual text for each chunk\nIt required more window context model and space\n\nRetrieval Interleaved Generation (RIG)\nA technique devloped by google that enhances the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by integrating structured external data into their responses.Unlike standard LLMs that rely solely on their internal knowledge, RIG dynamically retrieves data from a trusted repository like Data Commons.This allows RIG to provide more accurate and reliable information by leveraging real-time data.\nHow it works\n\n\nIdentifying the Need for External Data: The LLM recognizes when a query requires external information beyond its internal knowledge, distinguishing between general knowledge and specific data-driven facts.\n\n\nGenerating a Natural Language Query: Once external data is needed, the model generates a natural language query, designed to interact with a data repository like Data Commons, for example, “What was the unemployment rate in California in 2020?”\n\n\nFetching and Integrating Data: The model sends the query to Data Commons through an API, retrieves relevant data from diverse datasets, and seamlessly incorporates it into its response.\n\n\nProviding a Verified Answer: The LLM uses the retrieved data to give a reliable, data-backed answer, reducing the risk of hallucinations and improving the trustworthiness of its output.\n\n\nLate Chunking\n\nLet say we have doc as Berin is captial of germany it is more then 3M population if we chunk as Berin is captial of germany and it is more then 3M population in second chunk we loose the context to avoid that\nWe first applies the transformer layer of the embedding model to the entire text or as much of it as possible. This generates a sequence of vector representations for each token that encompasses textual information from the entire text. Subsequently, mean pooling is applied to each chunk of this sequence of token vectors, yielding embeddings for each chunk that consider the entire text’s contex\nIt required large context window model\n\nThe process of converting a sequence of embeddings into a sentence embedding is called pooling\nMean pooling in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technique used to create a fixed-size vector representation from a variable-length input sequence, such as a sentence or document. It works by averaging the vectors of all tokens (words or subwords) in the sequence\n\nTokenization: The input text is split into tokens (words, subwords, or characters).\nEmbedding: Each token is mapped to a corresponding vector using an embedding layer (e.g., pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings).\nMean Pooling: The vectors of all the tokens in the sequence are averaged to produce a single vector. This can be done by summing the vectors and then dividing by the total number of tokens.\n\nResources\nFrameworks and Toolkits for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):\n\nPinecone Canopy: A framework built by Pinecone for developing vector-based applications.\nFlashRAG: A Python toolkit for efficient RAG research, designed to support retrieval-augmented generation use cases.\nRAGFlow: An open-source RAG engine focusing on deep document understanding for more advanced RAG applications.\n\nCourses and Learning Resources:\n\nIntroduction to RAG by Ben: Educational material to help understand the fundamentals and implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\nLLM Twin Course: A course focused on using twin architectures for RAG-based research and projects.\n\nResearch Repositories and Articles:\n\nRAG Techniques: A GitHub repository that compiles techniques, methods, and best practices for working with RAG systems.\nBeyond the Basics of RAG: Advanced topics and concepts for pushing the limits of RAG technology.\nMicrosoft AutoGen**: A toolkit provided by Microsoft to automate the process of generating language models and leveraging RAG workflows.\n\n\nGenerative Representational Instruction Tuning\nMicro Agent\nThe idea of a micro agent is to\n\nCreate a definitive test case that can give clear feedback if the code works as intended or not, and\nIterate on code until all test cases pass\n\ngithub.com/BuilderIO/micro-agent\nCrew AI\nAlternative to auto gen\n\nShorterm memory\nlong term memory\nenitiy memory\n\nTools\n\nAgent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.\nTask Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.\n\nNote: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.\nNerve\nRed team with AI\nNerve is a tool that creates stateful agents with any LLM — without writing a single line of code. Agents created with Nerve are capable of both planning and enacting step-by-step whatever actions are required to complete a user-defined task.\nAgent with no code\n\ndify\nmindpal.space/\n\nAgent flow\n\ngraph based\nevent based\n\nUnstructured Data for LLM\n\nunstructured.io/\n\ngithub.com/WooooDyy/LLM-Agent-Paper-List"},"notes/2024/AI-Content-System":{"title":"AI Content System","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Ikigai method\nYour goal is to help the user identify their core content pillars for posting on social media.

It fetches relevant information or context (e.g., documentation or specific API references) related to the initial prompt to help guide the model.\nExample: After the initial prompt, De-Hallucinator searches for information about database connection APIs that might be relevant, like APIs from the same programming environment.\n\n\n\nIterative Prompt:\n\nEven after the retrieval step, the model might still produce code that’s partially incorrect or “hallucinated” (wrong). So, De-Hallucinator uses the generated code itself as a clue and refines the next prompt. This iterative process continues, narrowing down on the correct API or function.\nExample: If the model produces code using an API that looks similar but isn’t quite right, De-Hallucinator refines the query using that generated code to search for project-specific APIs. In the next round, the model will generate code that is much more accurate.\n\n\n\nPromptriever: Instruction-Trained Retrievers Can Be Prompted Like Language Models\nProblem Statement\nModern information retrieval (IR) models generally match queries to passages based on a single semantic similarity score. As a result, the user experience of search can be opaque, with users needing to find particular keywords/phrasings, apply various filters in advanced search settings, and iterate based on previous searches to find the “just right” query that returns the desired passages.\nThey introduce Promptriever: a retrieval model that can instead be controlled via natural language prompts\nSolution\n\nPromptriever is a bi-encoder retriever, meaning it encodes both the query and the document separately using a pre-trained large language model (LLaMA-2 7B, for example).\nUnlike traditional retrieval models that rely on fixed semantic similarity between queries and documents, Promptriever is trained to follow instructions.\nDuring training, each query is paired with instance-level instructions (e.g., “Find documents that discuss movies directed by James Cameron before 2022”) that modify what is considered relevant for that specific query.\nThese instructions are incorporated to adjust how the model understands “relevance” on a per-query basis.\nThe model is trained on a curated dataset of ~500K query-passage pairs, where each pair is augmented with an instruction that defines relevance in detail.\n\nPrompt used for instruction generation\n## Input Data\nI have the following query and REL_DOCS_NUM_FILL_ME documents which have been marked as relevant and NON_REL_DOCS_NUM_FILL_ME which are non-relevant.\n\n**Query:** QUERY_FILL_ME  \n**Positive Document:** POS_DOC_FILL_ME  \n**Negative Document:** NEG_DOC_FILL_ME  \n\n## Your task\nI need you to come up with an instruction that can be appended onto the end of this query that will make only one relevant document and make all other documents (including previously relevant docs) non-relevant. You can choose which document will stay relevant to the new instruction by writing an instruction that applies to only one of the relevant documents (you choose). This additional instruction should provide a test for strong frontier language models to determine if they can follow instructions. Triple-check your work to be certain that the chosen document is still relevant and that the others are non-relevant – if you mess up, you will be fired. Do not give away the answer in the instruction!\n\nFor this example, please generate the instruction to be LENGTH_FORMAT_FILL_ME. In the instructions, provide detailed specifics for what makes a document relevant. Remember that this criteria should make the one document relevant and all others irrelevant. Also, be sure that the instruction is generic and does not contain the answer to the query.\n\n**Output the response in JSON form only with no other text**, with the keys: \n- “instruction” (str) \n- “relevant_docs” (one document id that is the first doc, e.g. “[2]”) \n- “non-relevant_docs” (all other document ids, e.g. “[1,3,...]”). \n\n## Your output (JSON only):\n\nDataSet:  MS MARCO\nAceCoder: Utilizing Existing Code to Enhance Code Generation\nIntro\nA new method called AceCoder for generating code. This method aims to tackle two main challenges: understanding requirements and implementing code. AceCoder has two new features to help with these issues:\n\n\nGuided code generation: This feature makes large language models (LLMs) first analyze the requirements and create a preliminary output, like test cases. This helps clarify what is needed and guides the LLMs on what to write.\n\n\nExample retrieval: This feature finds similar programs to use as examples in prompts. These examples provide useful content, such as algorithms and APIs, and show the LLMs how to write the code.\n\n\nSolution\nWhen we directly ask A LLM to generate a code for snake game it may generate but not efficient but if we use give the proper requirement and determine specific details, e.g., input-output formats, and possible exceptions it can do better so to sovle that\nThey Design a special prompt consisting of triple examples (i.e., ). A preliminary is a specific software artifact (e.g., test cases, APIs) for clarifying the requirement\nGiven a new requirement, based on the prompt, LLMs first output a preliminary and then generate code based on the preliminary\nAfter understanding the requirement, how to implement the source code using a programming language is challenging\nThey propose using example retrieval, which is based on how human developers reuse code. In real-life situations, when faced with a new requirement, developers often look for similar programs to learn from or reuse parts of them.\nSpecifically, we use a retriever to find programs with similar requirements, selecting the top 20 results. Since large language models (LLMs) have a limit on input length (like 1024 tokens), we can only include a few examples in a prompt—typically three. To manage this, we designed a selector that filters out unnecessary programs and chooses the most helpful examples. These selected examples are then added to prompts to guide the LLMs on how to write the code.\nExample:\n\nlet say we want to write a unit test for the given program first we can send a program to LLM and ask for the what all the unit test case we can write for this funciton get a response\nuse the response again send that to LLM and ask to write a test case\n\nCode Chain\nCodeChain introduces modularity in code generation by using chain-of-thought prompting to help LLMs break down solutions into modular segments, each representing a high-level task. To enhance this process, we implement a series of self-revisions based on sampled sub-modules:\n\nWe extract sub-modules from generated programs and group them into clusters. We then select centroid sub-modules as representative, reusable code parts.\nWe enhance the original prompts with these selected sub-modules and guide LLMs to create new modular solutions.\n\nThis method allows LLMs to leverage insights from past modular components, improving their future code generation like an experienced developer would.\nCOT prompt\nDevelop a well-structured Python solution for the provided problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. Ensure modularity while considering potential edge cases and failures. Start by outlining the required code modules, including function headers and signatures. Subsequently, proceed to implement each module to create the final code.\n\n(modules) with clear function names and input/output specifications. Once the structure is ready, write the actual code for each module to complete the solution.\n\nThink Outside the Code: Brainstorming Boosts Large Language Models in Code Generation\nBRAINSTORM Framework\nThe BRAINSTORM framework decomposes the generation task into three steps:\n\n\nBrainstorming: Multiple prompts are constructed and fed to a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse thoughts, which are high-level descriptions of potential solutions for the given problem.\n\n\nThoughts Selection: A neural model is utilized to rank and select the thought from the above step with the highest probability of solving the given problem. used (XLNet Model for this)\n\n\nWriting Code: A code generation model implements code based on the problem description and the selected thought.\n\n\nPrompt used to generate high level description for the problem\n### Prompt 1\n\nYour task is to read a problem description from Codeforces and provide a detailed explanation of your approach to solving the problem without including any code. Please ensure that your explanation is clear, concise, and easy to understand for someone who may not be familiar with the specific programming language or algorithm used.\n\nIn your response, please include:\n\n1. **Problem Statement Overview**: \n   - Summarize the key points of the problem statement, including the main objective.\n\n2. **Key Constraints and Requirements**: \n   - Highlight any important constraints or requirements that must be considered.\n\n3. **Approach to the Problem**:\n   - Explain how you approached the problem, detailing any relevant data structures, algorithms, or techniques used.\n\nPlease note that your response should be flexible enough to allow for various relevant and creative approaches to solving the problem.\n\n\nPROMPT 2\n\nRead a problem description on Codeforces and use your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics to provide ideas for solving it. When giving an idea for solving a problem, please analyze the range of input values in detail to determine the appropriate time complexity to avoid timeout errors. \n\nPlease note that your answers should not contain any form of code or programming language.\n\nTo make your problem-solving ideas more creative and unique, be sure to fully explain the algorithms, data structures, and mathematical concepts involved. At the same time, when discussing time complexity, please explain in as much detail as possible.\n\n\n\nPrincipled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5/4\nThis paper introduces 26 guiding principles designed to streamline the process of querying and prompting large language models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipleDetails1No need to be polite with LLM, so there is no need to add phrases like “please,” “if you don’t mind,” “thank you,” “I would like to,” etc., and get straight to the point.2Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field.3Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.4Employ affirmative directives such as ‘do,’ while steering clear of negative language like ‘don’t’.5When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts:  • Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.  • Explain to me like I’m 11 years old.  • Explain to me as if I’m a beginner in [field].  • Write the [essay/text/paragraph] using simple English like you’re explaining something to a 5-year-old.6Add “I’m going to tip $xxx for a better solution!”7Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting).8When formatting your prompt, start with ‘###Instruction###,’ followed by either ‘###Example###’ or ‘###Question###’ if relevant. Subsequently, present your content. Use one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.9Incorporate the following phrases: “Your task is” and “You MUST”.10Incorporate the following phrases: “You will be penalized”.11Use the phrase “Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner” in your prompts.12Use leading words like writing “think step by step”.13Add to your prompt the following phrase: “Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes”.14Allow the model to elicit precise details and requirements from you by asking you questions until he has enough information to provide the needed output (for example, “From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to…”).15To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: “Teach me the [Any theorem/topic/rule name] and include a test at the end, but don’t give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond”.16Assign a role to the large language models.17Use Delimiters.18Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.19Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts.20Use output primers, which involve concluding your prompt with the beginning of the desired output. Utilize output primers by ending your prompt with the start of the anticipated response.21To write an essay/text/paragraph/article or any type of text that should be detailed: “Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] for me on [topic] in detail by adding all the information necessary”.22To correct/change specific text without changing its style: “Try to revise every paragraph sent by users. You should only improve the user’s grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should not change the writing style, such as making a formal paragraph casual”.23When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: “From now and on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. [your question]”.24When you want to initiate or continue a text using specific words, phrases, or sentences, utilize the following prompt:  • I’m providing you with the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay…]: [Insert lyrics/words/sentence]’. Finish it based on the words provided. Keep the flow consistent.25Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow in order to produce content, in the form of the keywords, regulations, hints, or instructions.26To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions:  • Please use the same language based on the provided paragraph/title/text/essay/answer.\nUnsupervised Evaluation of Code LLMs with Round-Trip Correctness\nTo evaluate large language models of code they introduced a new approach\nRound-Trip Correctness (RTC) method for evaluating code LLMs:\n\n\nForward Pass: The LLM performs a coding task, such as converting code to text or applying edits to code based on natural language instructions.\n\n\nBackward Pass: The LLM is then asked to reverse the task, generating code from the text description or reconstructing the original code before edits.\n\n\nSemantic Equivalence Check: The final step involves comparing the original input with the output of the backward pass to ensure they are semantically equivalent. This can be done using:\n\nDiscrete metrics (e.g., exact match).\nContinuous metrics (e.g., CodeBLEU, CodeBERTScore).\nExecution-based oracles (e.g., unit test execution, if available).\n\n\n\nPlanning In Natural Language Improves LLM Search For Code Generation\nSuggest a  PLANSEARCH, a novel search algorithm that explicitly searches for a diverse set of plans, expressed in natural language, before generating code\nHow it works\nImagine a coding problem where the user needs to find the longest increasing subsequence within a given array.\nHere’s how PLANSEARCH would approach it:\n\n\nPrompting for First-Order Observations: PLANSEARCH starts by prompting the LLM with the problem and asking for general observations, not code. This encourages exploration of diverse solution avenues.\n\n\nExample Prompt: “You are an expert Python programmer. Given the task of finding the longest increasing subsequence within an array, what are some useful observations or hints about this problem? Do not provide any code yet.”\n\n\nPossible LLM Observations: * “The order of elements in the subsequence matters.” * “We need to keep track of previously encountered elements.” * “The longest increasing subsequence might not be unique.”\n\n\n\n\nDeriving Second-Order Observations: PLANSEARCH takes subsets of the first-order observations and feeds them back to the LLM, along with the original problem, to derive deeper insights.\n\nExample Prompt (using a subset of observations from step 1): “You are an expert Python programmer. Here’s a problem: find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. Consider these observations: 1) ‘The order of elements in the subsequence matters.’ 2) ‘We need to keep track of previously encountered elements.’ Building upon these, can you provide additional, more specific observations relevant to solving this problem? Remember, no code yet.”\nPossible LLM Observations (O2): * “We could use dynamic programming to store and update the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element.” * “Binary search could be used to efficiently find the position to insert a new element while maintaining the increasing order.”\n\n\n\nFrom Observations to Code: PLANSEARCH prompts the LLM to generate a natural language solution, drawing upon the generated observations.\n\nExample Prompt (using observations from steps 1 &amp; 2): “Here’s the problem: find the longest increasing subsequence within an array. Here are some helpful observations: [… list of observations from O1 and O2… ] Based on these observations, describe in natural language a strategy to solve this problem. Be clear and specific.”\nPossible LLM Solution Sketch: “We can iterate through the array, and for each element, use binary search to find the position in the previously computed subsequence where it can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. We keep track of the longest subsequence length encountered.”\n\n\n\nImplementation: The natural language solution is translated to pseudocode and finally into Python.5 This granular approach minimizes errors that might arise from directly generating code from complex observations.\n\nExample: The LLM’s solution sketch from step 3 would be translated first into pseudocode and then into functioning Python code.\n\n\n\nLLMS KNOW MORE THAN THEY SHOW: ON THE INTRINSIC REPRESENTATION OF LLM HALLUCINATIONS\nDataset\n\n\nHumanEval: Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code\n\n\nMostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP): The benchmark consists of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, designed to be solvable by entry level programmers\n\n\nCoderEval , ClassEval  and EvoCodeBench\n\n"},"notes/2024/AI-in-Coding":{"title":"AI in Coding","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Discover vulnerabilities across a codebase with CodeQL, our industry-leading semantic code analysis engine.

It can process inputs of different modalities such as textual, visual, and auditory input, and convert them into an embedding format that LLM-based agents can understand and process, laying the foundation for reasoning and decision-making actions of LLM-based agents.\n\n\nMemory: The memory modules include semantic, episodic, and procedural memory, which can provide additional useful information to help LLM make reasoning decisions\n\n\nSemantic Memory: Semantic memory stores acknowledged world knowledge of LLM-based agents, usually in the form of external knowledge retrieval bases which include documents, libraries, APIs,\n\n\nEpisodic Memory: Episodic memory records content related to the current case and experience information from previous decision-making processes. Content related to the current case (such as relevant information found in the search database, samples provided by In-context learning (ICL) technology, etc.)\n\n\nProcedural Memory: The procedural memory of Agents in software engineering contains the implicit knowledge stored in the LLM weights and the explicit knowledge written in the agent’s code.\n\n\n\n\nAction : The action module includes two types: internal and external actions. The external actions interact with the external environment to obtain feedback information, including Dialogue with humans/agents and interaction with the digital environment, while the internal actions reason and make decisions based on the input of the LLM and refine the decision based on the obtained feedback, including reasoning, retrieval, and learning actions.\n\nInternal Action: can be classified as\n\nReasoning Action (COT,AutoCOT,Brainstorm framework,tree-shaped CoT),\nRetrieval Action\n\nText-code (APIRetriever,De-Hallucinator)\nText-Text (DocPrompting,CodeAgent)\nCode-Code (RepoCoder,RepoFusion)\nHybrid-Code (ToolCoder,Query Expansion)\nCode-Hybrid (CEDAR,Multi-intent)\nText-Hybrid (LAIL,AceCoder)\n\n\nLearning Action: Learning actions are continuously learning and updating knowledge by learning and updating semantic and procedural memories, thereby improving the quality and efficiency of reasoning and decision-making (CodGen)\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Action: Agents can interact with humans or other agents, and get rich information in the interaction process as feedback, expanding the knowledge of the agent and refining the answers of LLM more corrector (REFINER,PPOCoder,RLTF)\n\n\nCheck out more research paper about SE Agent here\nRepo Coder\nRepoCoder: Repository-Level Code Completion Through Iterative Retrieval and Generation\nRepoCoder Framework\n\n\nCore Idea: RepoCoder improves upon traditional In-File and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods by iterating between retrieval and code generation. It continuously refines its retrieval process using the generated code from prior iterations to narrow down more relevant context from the repository.\n\n\nComponents:\n\nRetriever: Searches for relevant code snippets from the repository based on the incomplete code.\nGenerator: Uses a pre-trained language model (such as GPT-3.5) to generate the completed code based on the retrieved snippets.\nIterative Process: By iterating between retrieval and generation, RepoCoder refines the search query and retrieves more accurate code snippets with each iteration.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Limitations\n\nLow Code Duplication: RepoCoder’s performance might not significantly improve in repositories with minimal code duplication\nIteration Optimization: Determining the optimal number of iterations for retrieval-generation is a challenge, as performance gains might not always be consistent with more iterations.\nReal-Time Deployment: While effective, RepoCoder’s iterative nature can introduce latency, which might not be suitable for real-time applications without optimizations like caching or model acceleration.\n\nCheck out code here\nTo understand how GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and Amazon CodeWhisperer work, you can explore several research papers and technical reports that discuss the underlying models and techniques used in these tools.

For instance, in the sentence:\n“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”\nIf we want to predict the word “fox” (target word), the context words might be “The”, “quick”, “brown”, “jumps”, “over”.\nExample Process for CBOW:\n\nInput Context Words: Let’s consider a simplified version where we use a window of size 2 (two words on each side of the target word).\n\nContext words for “fox” would be [“quick”, “brown”, “jumps”, “over”].\n\n\nOne-Hot Encoding: Each context word is converted into a one-hot vector. If our vocabulary consists of the words [“The”, “quick”, “brown”, “fox”, “jumps”, “over”, “the”, “lazy”, “dog”], the one-hot vector for “quick” might look like: “quick” → [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nHidden Layer: These one-hot vectors are fed into a neural network with a single hidden layer. The hidden layer typically has fewer neurons than the vocabulary size, capturing the dense representations.\nOutput Layer: The network then combines the hidden layer’s outputs to predict the target word. The output is a probability distribution over the vocabulary.\nTraining: The network is trained using backpropagation to minimize the prediction error, adjusting weights to improve accuracy.\n\nSkip-gram\nThe Skip-gram model works oppositely to CBOW. It predicts context words from the target word. This model is particularly effective for larger datasets.\nExample Process for Skip-gram:\nUsing the same sentence, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”:\n\nTarget Word: Let’s choose “fox” as our target word.\nContext Words: For “fox”, the context words could be [“quick”, “brown”, “jumps”, “over”] using a window size of 2.\nOne-Hot Encoding: Convert the target word “fox” into a one-hot vector.\n\n“fox” → [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\nHidden Layer: This one-hot vector is fed into the hidden layer, producing a dense vector representation of the target word.\nOutput Layer: The dense vector is then used to predict the context words. The network outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each context word.\nTraining: The network is trained by adjusting the weights to maximize the probability of the correct context words given the target word.\n\nCosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two vectors\nEuclidean Distance: It measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in the multidimensional space\nManhattan Distance (L1 Distance): This calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of two vectors.\nOne-hot encoding is a technique used to represent categorical data as binary vectors. Each category is converted into a vector where one element is “hot” (1) and all other elements are “cold” (0).\nExample: Let say we take fruits and consider it only having 5 varites such as apple,orange,mango,grapes and banana the one hot encoding will be\n\n“apple” → [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n“orange” → [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n“mango” → [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n“grapes” → [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n“banana” → [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nThe main disadvantage is If the number of unique categories is very large, the resulting one-hot encoded data can become very high-dimensional and sparse.\nStemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form by removing suffixes, such as converting “running” to “run” and “happily” to “happi”.\nLemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form (lemma) by considering the context and morphological analysis, such as converting “running” to “run” and “better” to “good”.\nlib that used for above nltk, spacy in python\nwww.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/word2vec\nGloVe\nGlobal Vectors for Word Representation.Unlike other word embedding methods like Word2Vec, which rely on local context information (e.g., predicting a word based on its neighbors), GloVe leverages global word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus to capture the meanings of words.\nGloVe constructs a word-word co-occurrence matrix using the entire corpus. Each element of this matrix represents how often a pair of words appears together in a context window like below let say we have a “The cat is fluffy. The dog is fluffy. The cat and the dog are friends.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordthecatisfluffydogandarefriendsthe02222111cat20111100is21021000fluffy21201000dog21110100and11001011are10000101friends10000110\nWe create vectors (magic numbers) for each word.

This layer is defined as the first layer of a more complex architecture. The embedding layer needs at least three input values:\n\ninput_dim: Integer. Size of the vocabulary, i.e. maximum integer index+1.\noutput_dim: Integer. Dimension of the dense embedding.\ninput_length: Length of input sequences, when it is constant. This argument is required if you are going to connect Flatten then Dense layers upstream (without it, the shape of the dense outputs cannot be computed).\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Embedding, Flatten, Dense\n \n# Sample training data\ntexts = [\n    &quot;I love this movie, it is fantastic!&quot;,\n    &quot;The movie was okay, not great.&quot;,\n    &quot;I did not like the movie, it was boring.&quot;,\n    &quot;Fantastic film, I enjoyed every moment!&quot;,\n    &quot;Terrible movie, I won&#039;t watch it again.&quot;\n]\nlabels = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative\n \n# Tokenize the text\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=10000)\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)\nsequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)\n \n# Pad sequences to ensure uniform length\nmax_length = 10\ndata = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_length)\n \n# Convert labels to a numpy array\nlabels = np.array(labels)\n \n# Define vocabulary size and embedding dimensions\nvocab_size = 10000\nembedding_dim = 50\n \n# Create the model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=max_length))\nmodel.add(Flatten())\nmodel.add(Dense(1, activation=&#039;sigmoid&#039;))  # For binary classification\n \n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer=&#039;adam&#039;, loss=&#039;binary_crossentropy&#039;, metrics=[&#039;accuracy&#039;])\n \n# Print the model summary\nmodel.summary()\n \n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=2, validation_split=0.2)\n \n# Sample test data\ntest_texts = [\n    &quot;I really enjoyed this film, it was excellent!&quot;,\n    &quot;The film was not good, I did not enjoy it.&quot;,\n]\ntest_labels = [1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative\n \n# Tokenize the test text\ntest_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_texts)\n \n# Pad sequences to ensure uniform length\ntest_data = pad_sequences(test_sequences, maxlen=max_length)\n \n# Convert test labels to a numpy array\ntest_labels = np.array(test_labels)\n \n# Evaluate the model on the test data\nloss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, batch_size=2)\nprint(f&quot;Test Loss: {loss}&quot;)\nprint(f&quot;Test Accuracy: {accuracy}&quot;)\n \n# Make predictions on the test data\npredictions = model.predict(test_data)\n \n# Print the predictions and corresponding test labels\nfor i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):\n    print(f&quot;Text: {test_texts[i]}&quot;)\n    print(f&quot;Predicted: {&#039;Positive&#039; if prediction &gt; 0.5 else &#039;Negative&#039;}&quot;)\n    print(f&quot;Actual: {&#039;Positive&#039; if test_labels[i] == 1 else &#039;Negative&#039;}\\n&quot;)\n \nOpen Source Embedding models\nTwo key resources for open-source embeddings:\n\nSentence Transformers (expert.net): This Python framework simplifies loading and using various embedding models, including the popular “all-mpnet-base-v2” and “all-MiniLM-L6-v2”.\nHugging Face (huggingface.co): This platform hosts a vast collection of machine learning models and datasets, including the “Massive Text Embedding Benchmark” (MTEB) project, which ranks and evaluates embedding models.\n\nChoosing the Right Embedding Model\n\nTask: Different models specialize in different tasks, like semantic search, clustering, or bitext mining.\nPerformance: The MTEB leaderboard offers a valuable resource for comparing model performance across various tasks.\nDimension Size: Smaller dimensions generally result in faster computation and lower memory requirements, especially for similarity searches.\nSequence Length: Models have limitations on the input length (measured in tokens), impacting how you process longer documents.\n\nOptimizing Embedding Generation\n\n\nMean Pooling: This aggregation method combines multiple embeddings into a single representative embedding, essential for sentence-level comparisons.\nExample:\nText embedding model will return text the probablity of passed text with the no of vocabulary it has let say we have a text embedding model with dimension of 468 then it have 468 voc so it will return the probablity of passed text with all 468 word but if we want a single probablity we need to use meanpooling\n\n\nNormalization: Normalizing embeddings (creating unit vectors) enables accurate comparisons using methods like dot product.\n\n\nQuantization: This technique reduces the precision of model weights, shrinking the model size and potentially improving inference speed.\n\n\nCaching: Transformers.js automatically caches models in the browser, significantly speeding up subsequent inference operations.\n\n\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE): A Tokenization Technique\nBPE is a data compression algorithm that has been adapted for tokenization. It’s a bottom-up approach that starts by treating each character in the training data as a separate token. Then, it iteratively merges the most frequently occurring pairs of tokens into a single new token. This process continues until a predefined vocabulary size or a merging criteria is met.\nLet’s illustrate with a simplified example. Suppose our training data contains the words “lower,” “lowest,” “newer,” and “newest.”\n\n\nInitial Tokens: Start with individual characters as tokens: ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘w’, ‘e’, ‘r’, ‘s’, ‘t’, ‘n’, ‘ew’.\n\n\nMerging: The pair ‘e’ and ‘r’ might occur most frequently, so they are merged into a new token ‘er’.\n\n\nWordPiece\nWordPiece tokenization is a subword tokenization algorithm developed by Google,\nMassive Text Embedding Benchmark\nMTEB, is a project developed by Hugging Face to address the challenge of evaluating and comparing the performance of different text embedding models\nMTEB goes beyond a single metric and instead evaluates models across a wide spectrum of tasks1. This ensures a more holistic understanding of a model’s capabilities. Some of the tasks covered by MTEB include2:\nBitext Mining: Identifying pairs of sentences in different languages that convey the same meaning.\nClassification: Assigning predefined categories to text snippets.\nClustering: Grouping text snippets based on their semantic similarity.\nPair Classification: Determining the relationship between two text snippets (e.g., paraphrase, contradiction).\nRe-ranking: Ordering search results based on their relevance to a given query.\nRetrieval: Finding the most relevant documents for a specific query (often used in semantic search).\nSemantic Textual Similarity (STS): Measuring the degree of semantic overlap between two text snippets.\nSummarization: Evaluating how well a short text summarizes a longer document.\nResources\n\nmedium.com/@RobinVetsch/nlp-from-word-embedding-to-transformers-76ae124e6281\nText Embeddings: Comprehensive Guide\n\nTransformer\nTypes\n\nEncode only model → translate tokens in to semantically meaningful rep (text classfication)\nDecode only model → predict next text (Text genereation)  GPT family and LLAMA\nBoth encode and decode model → BART (translation)\n\nEncoder: Encodes input with context val understanding and produces one vector per token\nDecoder: Accept input token and generate new token\nMax new tokens: No of tokens that will generate\nNatural language model\nLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) are techniques used in the field of natural language processing and machine learning to fine-tune large pre-trained models in a more computationally and memory-efficient manner.\nollama Notes\n\nuses docker to run all model\nModel stored in  /user/share/ollama/.ollama/models\nwhich has blobs and manifests/registry.ollama.ai\nblobs contain actula model code\n\nVector database\nA dataset of three sentences, each has 3 words (or tokens)\n\nIn practice, a dataset may contain millions or billions of sentences.\nThe max number of tokens may be tens of thousands (e.g., 32,768 mistral-7b).\n\nProcess “how are you”\nWord Embeddings\n\nFor each word, look up corresponding word embedding vector from a table of 22 vectors, where 22 is the vocabulary size.\nIn practice, the vocabulary size can be tens of thousands. The word embedding dimensions are in the thousands (e.g., 1024, 4096)\n\nEncoding\n\nFeed the sequence of word embeddings to an encoder to obtain a sequence of feature vectors, one per word.\nHere, the encoder is a simple one layer perceptron (linear layer + ReLU)\nIn practice, the encoder is a transformer or one of its many variants.\n\nMean Pooling\n\nMerge the sequence of feature vectors into a single vector using “mean pooling” which is to average across the columns.\nThe result is a single vector. We often call it “text embeddings” or “sentence embeddings.”\nOther pooling techniques are possible, such as CLS. But mean pooling is the most common.\n\nIndexing\n\nReduce the dimensions of the text embedding vector by a projection matrix. The reduction rate is 50% (4→2).\nIn practice, the values in this projection matrix is much more random.  The purpose is similar to that of hashing, which is to obtain a short representation to allow faster comparison and retrieval.\nThe resulting dimension-reduced index vector is saved in the vector storage.\n\nProcess “who are you”\n\nRepeat Word Embeddings to indexing\n\nQuery: “am I you”\n\nRepeat Word Embeddings to indexing\nThe result is a 2-d query vector.\n\nDot Products\n\nTake dot product between the query vector and database vectors.

By streamlining the complete model development cycle, including tasks such as data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, AutoML frameworks significantly economize on the time and effort customarily expended by data scientists.\nFinetune\nLoRA:\n\nIntroduce two low-rank matrices, A and B, to work alongside the weight matrix W.\nAdjust these matrices instead of the behemoth W, making updates manageable.\n\nLoRA-FA (Frozen-A):\n\nTakes LoRA a step further by freezing matrix A.\nOnly matrix B is tweaked, reducing the activation memory needed.\n\nVeRA:\n\nAll about efficiency: matrices A and B are fixed and shared across all layers.\nFocuses on tiny, trainable scaling vectors in each layer, making it super memory-friendly.\n\nDelta-LoRA:\n\nA twist on LoRA: adds the difference (delta) between products of matrices A and B across training steps to the main weight matrix W.\nOffers a dynamic yet controlled approach to parameter updates.\n\nLoRA+:\n\nAn optimized variant of LoRA where matrix B gets a higher learning rate.\nThis tweak leads to faster and more effective learning.\n\nResources\n\nLLORA  for finetuning\nFine tune LLMs 2024\n\nModel Merging\nModel merging is an efficient alternative to fine-tuning that leverages the work of the open-source community. It involves combining the weights of different fine-tuned models to create a new model with enhanced capabilities. This technique has proven highly effective, as demonstrated by the dominance of merged models in performance benchmarks.\nMerging Techniques\n\nSLURP (Spherical Linear Interpolation): Interpolates the weights of two models using spherical linear interpolation. Different interpolation factors can be applied to various layers, allowing for fine-grained control.\nDecomposed Redundancy Addition (DeRA): Reduces redundancy in model parameters through pruning and rescaling of weights. This technique allows merging multiple models simultaneously.\nPass-Through: Concatenates layers from different LLMs, including the possibility of concatenating layers from the same model (self-merging).\nMixture of Experts (MoE): Combines feed-forward network layers from different fine-tuned models, using a router to select the appropriate layer for each token and layer. This technique can be implemented without fine-tuning by initializing the router using embeddings calculated from positive prompts.\n\nAdvantages of Model Merging:\n\nNo GPU requirement, making it highly efficient.\nAbility to leverage existing fine-tuned models from the open-source community.\nProven effectiveness in producing high-quality models.\n\n1 Bit LLM\n BitNet b1.58 where every weight in a Transformer can be represented as a {-1, 0, 1} instead of a floating point number.\nLAMA Notes\nLAMA 2 All are instruction tunned model\n\nlama2 7B instruction\nlama2 13B instruction\nlama2 70B instruction\nlama2 7B Chat\nlama2 13B Chat\nlama2 70B Chat\n\nCode lama\n\n7B/13B/34B has both base model and instruct model\n\nPurpel lama\n\nGenerative AI safety model wil take care of check does the genreated code is safe\nCybersecEval dataset to test\nlama Gaurd → check input and output\n\n[INST] -&gt; addd by lama to identify the inst tag base model dont undertstand\n&lt;/s&gt; -&gt; ending tag\n\n\n\nLama we need to manully add INST and end tag with\n\n\nLlama Stack was introduced to address the challenges of integrating Llama models into existing workflows.10 It provides a stable API and CLI, simplifying tasks like downloading models, inspecting their properties, and deploying them.11 Llama Stack also incorporates features like memory, RAG, and safety orchestration using multiple models. github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack\n\n\nGEMINI Notes\n\nultra\npro → performance and speed\nflash → fastest and low cost\nnano →\n\nLarge multimodal model → can handel both image and other input type\nfine tune\nLLM traning methods\nCausal Language Modeling (CLM)\nCLM is an autoregressive method where the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens. CLM is used in models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 and is well-suited for tasks such as text generation and summarization. However, CLM models have unidirectional context, meaning they only consider the past and not the future context when generating predictions.\nMasked Language Modeling (MLM)\nMLM is a training method used in models like BERT, where some tokens in the input sequence are masked, and the model learns to predict the masked tokens based on the surrounding context. MLM has the advantage of bidirectional context, allowing the model to consider both past and future tokens when making predictions. This approach is especially useful for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.\nSequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)\nSeq2Seq models consist of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence. This approach is commonly used in tasks like machine translation, summarization, and question-answering. Seq2Seq models can handle more complex tasks that involve input-output transformations, making them versatile for a wide range of NLP tasks."},"notes/2024/AWS":{"title":"AWS","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Cell-Based Architecture\nnewsletter.systemdesign.one/p/cell-based-architecture\nslack.engineering/slacks-migration-to-a-cellular-architecture/\nVPC\nSubnets: we can create subnets within a VPC to divide the network into public and private sections.

Clearing the cache can help free up storage space, but it won’t delete essential app data.\n\n\n/mnt or /storage: These directories are used for mounting external storage devices like SD cards or USB drives. The actual path may vary across devices and Android versions.\n\n\n/sdcard or /storage/emulated/0: This is the default directory for the primary external storage on the device. It’s often used to store user-accessible files such as photos, videos, and downloaded content. Note that on many modern devices, the “sdcard” directory might actually be part of the internal storage and not necessarily refer to an external SD card.\n\n\n/proc: This virtual directory contains information about system processes.

Once the bootloader hands control over, the Linux kernel is loaded into memory.\nThe kernel initializes the device’s hardware, such as the CPU, memory, display, input devices, and various peripherals.\n\n\nInit Process:\n\nThe init process is the first user-space process started by the Linux kernel. It has process ID 1 and is responsible for initializing the Android system.\nThe init process reads the init.rc file, which contains instructions for initializing various system properties and starting essential system services.\n\n\nZygote and System Server:\n\nThe Zygote process is a special system process that serves as a template for creating new application processes. It helps to speed up the launch of apps by preloading some common resources.\nThe system server is started by the init process and manages core system services like the package manager, window manager, and telephony services.\n\n\nAndroid Runtime (ART or Dalvik):\n\nThe Android Runtime (ART) or Dalvik (in older versions) is responsible for running Android applications. ART is the default runtime as of Android 5.0 (Lollipop).\nThe runtime loads and executes the bytecode of Android apps.\n\n\nSystem Services and User Interface:\n\nAs the system server starts, it initiates various system services that are essential for the functioning of the Android operating system.\nThe user interface components, including the home screen and launcher, are also started during this phase.\n\n\nApp Launch:\n\nFinally, the Android device is ready for use, and the user can interact with the system.

Let’s break it down:\nWhat is Zero-Copy?\nZero-copy operations minimize unnecessary data duplication, although they don’t literally make zero copies.\nKafka’s Use of Zero-Copy\nKafka leverages the OS’s zero-copy optimization to bypass the Kafka broker Java program entirely when data is transferred from the page cache to the socket buffer.\nTraditional Data Transfer (Without Zero-Copy)\n\nRead buffer (OS page cache) - Stores data for quick access.\nSocket buffer - Manages data packets.\nNIC buffer - Network card’s byte buffer.\nDMA (Direct Memory Access) - Allows hardware to access memory without the CPU.\n\nSteps:\n\nDisk to OS buffer (DMA copy, user to kernel mode).\nOS buffer to app buffer (kernel to user mode).\nApp buffer to socket buffer (user to kernel mode).\nSocket buffer to NIC buffer (DMA copy, kernel to user mode).\n\nOptimized Data Transfer (With Zero-Copy)\nKafka stores data in a binary format compatible with its responses, skipping unnecessary steps:\n\nThe read buffer copies data directly to the NIC buffer.\nThe socket buffer stores read buffer pointers, enabling the DMA engine to read directly from memory.\n\nBenefits of Zero-Copy\n\nFewer user/kernel mode switches (reduced from 4 to 2).\nSame number of DMA copies (2).\nOne minimal CPU copy of pointers (2 fewer CPU copies).\n\nThe Reality Check\nDespite the efficiency gains, zero-copy might not significantly impact most Kafka deployments:\n\nThe network often saturates before CPU becomes a bottleneck.\nEncryption and SSL/TLS prevent zero-copy use.\n\nKafka remains performant even without zero-copy optimization.\n\n\nWhat is Kafka?\nKafka is a distributed event store and a streaming platform. It began as an internal project at LinkedIn and now powers some of the largest data pipelines in the world in orgs like Netflix, Uber, etc.\n\n\nKafka Messages\nMessage is the basic unit of data in Kafka. It’s like a record in a table consisting of headers, key, and value.\n\n\nKafka Topics and Partitions\nEvery message goes to a particular Topic. Think of the topic as a folder on your computer. Topics also have multiple partitions.\n\n\nAdvantages of Kafka\nKafka can handle multiple producers and consumers, while providing disk-based data retention and high scalability.\n\n\nKafka Producer\nProducers in Kafka create new messages, batch them, and send them to a Kafka topic. They also take care of balancing messages across different partitions.\n\n\nKafka Consumer\nKafka consumers work together as a consumer group to read messages from the broker.\n\n\nKafka Cluster\nA Kafka cluster consists of several brokers where each partition is replicated across multiple brokers to ensure high availability and redundancy.\n\n\nUse Cases of Kafka\nKafka can be used for log analysis, data streaming, change data capture, and system monitoring.\n\n\nsheet2 | DVOP3-Location | DVOP3-Qty | DVOP3-option Elected | DVOP3-INX Status | DVOP1-Location | DVOP1-Qty | DVOP1-option Elected | DVOP1-INX Status | | -------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | | 1MMIC | 1245 | Cash | Accepted | 1MMIC | 1478 | Secu | Accepted | | 5GHTY | 8975 | Secu | TBD | 5GHTY | 8888 | Secu | Accepted | | 5GHTY | 23 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 54 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | 123 | Cash | Accepted | 1V3CH | 123 | Cash | Accepted | | 1V3CH | 22 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 22 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | 44 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 44 | Secu | TBD | sheet1 | Eligiblelocation | Name | Address | Foreign Non-induvidual or Foreign Fund | Legal Status | TIN(IF 0 %) | Tax Rate | DVOP3-Location | DVOP3-Qty | DVOP3-option Elected | DVOP3-INX Status | DVOP1-Location | DVOP1-Qty | DVOP1-option Elected | DVOP1-INX Status | DVOP3-Location | DVOP1-Location | | ---------------- | ---- | ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- | | 1MCGH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1MMIC | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 5GHTY | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 5GHTY | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | after merge | Eligiblelocation | Name | Address | Foreign Non-induvidual or Foreign Fund | Legal Status | TIN(IF 0 %) | Tax Rate | DVOP3-Location | DVOP3-Qty_x | DVOP3-option Elected_x | DVOP3-INX Status_x | DVOP1-Location _x | DVOP1-Qty_x | DVOP1-option Elected_x | DVOP1-INX Status_x | DVOP3-Location | DVOP1-Location | DVOP3-Qty_y | DVOP3-option Elected_y | DVOP3-INX Status_y | DVOP1-Location _y | DVOP1-Qty_y | DVOP1-option Elected_y | DVOP1-INX Status_y | | ---------------- | ---- | ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | | 1MCGH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1MMIC | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1245 | Cash | Accepted | 1MMIC | 1478 | Secu | Accepted | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 123 | Cash | Accepted | 1V3CH | 123 | Cash | Accepted | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 22 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 22 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 44 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 44 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 123 | Cash | Accepted | 1V3CH | 123 | Cash | Accepted | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 22 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 22 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 44 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 44 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 123 | Cash | Accepted | 1V3CH | 123 | Cash | Accepted | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 22 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 22 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 44 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 44 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 123 | Cash | Accepted | 1V3CH | 123 | Cash | Accepted | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 22 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 22 | Secu | TBD | | 1V3CH | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 44 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 44 | Secu | TBD | | 5GHTY | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 8975 | Secu | TBD | 5GHTY | 8888 | Secu | Accepted | | 5GHTY | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 23 | Secu | TBD | 1V3CH | 54 | Secu | TBD | | 5GHTY | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | but it merege wrong fix the bug\nSure!

This means adhering strictly to standards, specifications, or well-defined contracts. Ensure that your outputs are clear, unambiguous, and follow established conventions.\nExample: HTTP specifications. where they have standard that need to follow when sending request\nLiberal in What You Accept from Others: On the receiving end,designing your system to handle various inputs gracefully, even if they deviate slightly from the expected standards.

An example of this is finding the longest subarray containing all 1s. This pattern is useful for problems that involve finding the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or value within a linear data structure, such as an array, linked list, or string. Some other problems you can solve using the Sliding Window pattern are:\n\nMaximum sum subarray of size ‘K’ (easy)\nLongest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (medium)\nString anagrams (hard)\n\n\n\nTwo Pointers or Iterators: This pattern involves using two pointers that iterate through a data structure until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition. This pattern is often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list. An example of this is when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements. Two pointers are needed because using just one pointer would require you to continually loop back through the array to find the answer. This back-and-forth process with a single iterator is inefficient for time and space complexity, also known as asymptotic analysis. Using a single pointer would result in a time complexity of O(n²), which is not optimal. Two pointers can help you find a solution with better space or runtime complexity. Ways to identify when to use the Two Pointer method:\n\nThe problem deals with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and you need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints\nThe set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray\nHere are some problems that feature the Two Pointer pattern:\n\nSquaring a sorted array (easy)\nTriplets that sum to zero (medium)\nComparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nFast and Slow pointers: This approach, also known as the Hare &amp; Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers that move through the array (or sequence/linked list) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or arrays. By moving at different speeds, the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop. How do you identify when to use the Fast and Slow pattern?\n\nThe problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array\nWhen you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.\nWhen should I use it over the Two Pointer method mentioned above?\n\nThere are some cases where you shouldn’t use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you can’t move in a backwards direction. An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when you’re trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.\nProblems featuring the fast and slow pointers pattern:\nLinked List Cycle (easy)\nPalindrome Linked List (medium)\nCycle in a Circular Array (hard)\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge Intervals: The Merge Intervals pattern is an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, you either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap. Understanding and recognizing these six cases of overlapping intervals will help you solve a wide range of problems from inserting intervals to optimizing interval merges. How do you identify when to use the Merge Intervals pattern?\n\nIf you’re asked to produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals\nIf you hear the term “overlapping intervals”. Merge interval problem patterns:\n\nIntervals Intersection (medium)\nMaximum CPU Load (hard)\n\n\n\n\n\nCyclic sort: This pattern describes an interesting approach to deal with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range. The Cyclic Sort pattern iterates over the array one number at a time, and if the current number you are iterating is not at the correct index, you swap it with the number at its correct index. You could try placing the number in its correct index, but this will produce a complexity of O(n^2) which is not optimal, hence the Cyclic Sort pattern. How do I identify this pattern?\n\nProblems involving a sorted array with numbers in a given range\nIf the problem asks you to find the missing/duplicate/smallest number in an unsorted/rotated array Problems featuring the cyclic sort pattern:\n\nFind the Missing Number (easy)\nFind the Smallest Missing Positive Number (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-place reversal of linked list: In a lot of problems, you may be asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a linked list. Often, the constraint is that you need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory. This pattern reverses one node at a time starting with one variable (current) pointing to the head of the linked list, and one variable (previous) will point to the previous node that you have processed. In a lock-step manner, you will reverse the current node by pointing it to the previous before moving on to the next node. Also, you will update the variable “previous” to always point to the previous node that you have processed. How do I identify when to use this pattern:\n\nIf you’re asked to reverse a linked list without using extra memory Problems featuring in-place reversal of linked list pattern:\n\nReverse a Sub-list (medium)\nReverse every K-element Sub-list (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nTree BFS: This pattern is based on the Breadth First Search (BFS) technique to traverse a tree and uses a queue to keep track of all the nodes of a level before jumping onto the next level. Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach. The Tree BFS pattern works by pushing the root node to the queue and then continually iterating until the queue is empty. For each iteration, we remove the node at the head of the queue and “visit” that node. After removing each node from the queue, we also insert all of its children into the queue. How to identify the Tree BFS pattern:\n\nIf you’re asked to traverse a tree in a level-by-level fashion (or level order traversal) Problems featuring Tree BFS pattern:\n\nBinary Tree Level Order Traversal (easy)\nZigzag Traversal (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nTree DFS: Tree DFS is based on the Depth First Search (DFS) technique to traverse a tree. You can use recursion (or a stack for the iterative approach) to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing. The Tree DFS pattern works by starting at the root of the tree, if the node is not a leaf you need to do three things:\n\n\nDecide whether to process the current node now (pre-order), or between processing two children (in-order) or after processing both children (post-order).\n\n\nMake two recursive calls for both the children of the current node to process them. How to identify the Tree DFS pattern:\n\n\n\nIf you’re asked to traverse a tree with in-order, preorder, or postorder DFS\nIf the problem requires searching for something where the node is closer to a leaf Problems featuring Tree DFS pattern:\n\nSum of Path Numbers (medium)\nAll Paths for a Sum (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo heaps: This pattern uses two heaps; A Min Heap to find the smallest element and a Max Heap to find the biggest element. The pattern works by storing the first half of numbers in a Max Heap, this is because you want to find the largest number in the first half. You then store the second half of numbers in a Min Heap, as you want to find the smallest number in the second half. At any time, the median of the current list of numbers can be calculated from the top element of the two heaps. Ways to identify the Two Heaps pattern:\n\nUseful in situations like Priority Queue, Scheduling\nIf the problem states that you need to find the smallest/largest/median elements of a set\nSometimes, useful in problems featuring a binary tree data structure Problems featuring Two Heaps pattern:\n\nFind the Median of a Number Stream (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsets: The pattern Subsets describes an efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) approach to handle problems involving Permutations and Combinations of a given set of elements. The pattern looks like this: Given a set of\n\nStart with an empty set: \nAdd the first number (1) to all the existing subsets to create new subsets: [[],];\nAdd the second number (5) to all the existing subsets: [[],,,];\nAdd the third number (3) to all the existing subsets: [[],,,,,,,].\n\nHow to identify the Subsets pattern:\n\nProblems where you need to find the combinations or permutations of a given set Problems featuring Subsets pattern:\n\nSubsets With Duplicates (easy)\nString Permutations by changing case (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nModified binary search: This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving Binary Search in a sorted array, linked list, or matrix. The patterns looks like this for an ascending order set:\n\n\nFirst, find the middle of start and end. An easy way to find the middle would be: middle = (start + end) / 2. But this has a good chance of producing an integer overflow so it’s recommended that you represent the middle as: middle = start + (end — start) / 2\n\n\nIf the key is equal to the number at index middle then return middle\n\n\nIf ‘key’ isn’t equal to the index middle:\n\n\nCheck if key &lt; arr[middle]. If it is reduce your search to end = middle — 1\n\n\nCheck if key &gt; arr[middle]. If it is reduce your search to end = middle + 1\nProblems featuring the Modified Binary Search pattern:\n\nOrder-agnostic Binary Search (easy)\nSearch in a Sorted Infinite Array (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nTop K elements: This pattern will make use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with ‘K’ elements at a time from a set of given elements. The best data structure to keep track of ‘K’ elements is Heap. This pattern is for problems that ask you to find the top/smallest/frequent ‘K’ elements among a given set. The pattern looks like this:\n\nInsert ‘K’ elements into the min-heap or max-heap based on the problem.\nIterate through the remaining numbers and if you find one that is larger than what you have in the heap, then remove that number and insert the larger one. There is no need for a sorting algorithm because the heap will keep track of the elements for you.\n\nHow to identify the Top ‘K’ Elements pattern:\n\nIf you’re asked to find the top/smallest/frequent ‘K’ elements of a given set\nIf you’re asked to sort an array to find an exact element Problems featuring Top ‘K’ Elements pattern:\n\nTop ‘K’ Numbers (easy)\nTop ‘K’ Frequent Numbers (medium)\n\n\n\n\n\nK-way Merge: K-way Merge helps you solve problems that involve a set of sorted arrays. Whenever you’re given ‘K’ sorted arrays, you can use a Heap to efficiently perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays. You can push the smallest element of each array in a Min Heap to get the overall minimum. After getting the overall minimum, push the next element from the same array to the heap. Then, repeat this process to make a sorted traversal of all elements. The pattern looks like this:\n\nInsert the first element of each array in a Min Heap.\nAfter this, take out the smallest (top) element from the heap and add it to the merged list.\nAfter removing the smallest element from the heap, insert the next element of the same list into the heap.\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 to populate the merged list in sorted order.\n\nHow to identify the K-way Merge pattern:\n\nThe problem will feature sorted arrays, lists, or a matrix\nIf the problem asks you to merge sorted lists, find the smallest element in a sorted list. Problems featuring the K-way Merge pattern:\n\nMerge K Sorted Lists (medium)\nK Pairs with Largest Sums (Hard)\n\n\n\n\n\nTopological Sort: Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event ‘B’ is dependent on event ‘A’, ‘A’ comes before ‘B’ in topological ordering. This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for performing topological sorting of a set of elements. The pattern works like this:\n\nInitialization a. Store the graph in adjacency lists by using a HashMap b. To find all sources, use a HashMap to keep the count of in-degrees Build the graph and find in-degrees of all vertices\nBuild the graph from the input and populate the in-degrees HashMap.\nFind all sources a. All vertices with ‘0’ in-degrees will be sources and are stored in a Queue.\nSort a. For each source, do the following things: —i) Add it to the sorted list. — ii)Get all of its children from the graph. — iii)Decrement the in-degree of each child by 1. — iv)If a child’s in-degree becomes ‘0’, add it to the sources Queue. b. Repeat (a), until the source Queue is empty.\n\nHow to identify the Topological Sort pattern:\n\nThe problem will deal with graphs that have no directed cycles\nIf you’re asked to update all objects in a sorted order\nIf you have a class of objects that follow a particular order Problems featuring the Topological Sort pattern:\n\nTask scheduling (medium)\nMinimum height of a tree (hard)\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nResources\n\nwww.stratascratch.com/\n"},"notes/2024/Database-Performance-at-Scale":{"title":"Database Performance at Scale","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Repo ­ github.com/Apress/db-performance-at-scale.\nrust-lang.github.io/mdBook/  mdBook “is a command line tool to create books with Markdown.\nYour Project, Through the Lens of Database Performance\nWrite-Heavy Workloads\nWrite-heavy workload,strongly recommend a database that stores data in immutable files (e.g., Cassandra, ScyllaDB, and others that use LSM trees). These databases optimize write speed because) writes are sequential, which is faster in terms of disk I/O ) writes are performed immediately, without first worrying about reading or updating existing values (like databases that rely on B trees do). As a result, you can typically write a lot of data with very low latencies.\nCompaction is a background process that databases with an LSM tree storage backend use to merge and optimize the shape of the data. Since files are immutable, the process essentially involves picking up two or more pre-existing files, merging their contents, and producing a sorted output file\nNote: Writes cost around five times more than reads under some vendors’ pricing models\nRead-Heavy Workloads\nB-tree databases (such as DynamoDB) are optimized for reads\ncold data vs hot data\ncold data: data that not acessing frequently\nhot data: data that are accessing frequently\nIf your ratio of cache misses is higher than hits, this means that reads need to\nfrequently hit the disks in order to look up your data\nCompeting Workloads (Real-Time vs Batch) → need to look again page no 21\nItem Size\nThe size of each document is matter let assume the default page cache size is 4kb the document size is 1MB it cannot be stored in cache it need more I/O\nbut large number of doc with small size may introduce CPU overhead\nMost write-optimized databases will store your writes in memory before persisting that information to the disk (in fact, that’s one of the reasons why they are write-optimized). Larger payloads deplete the available cache space more frequently, and this incurs a higher flushing activity to persist the information on disk in order to release space for more incoming writes. Therefore, more disk I/O is needed to persist that information. If you don’t size this properly, it can become a bottleneck throughout this repetitive process\nItem Type\nitem type has a large impact on compression.if you need to frequently process JSON data that you can’t easily transform, a document database like MongoDB might be a better option than a Cassandra-compatible database.\nSome databases also support user created fields, such asUser-Defined Types(UDTs) in Cassandra.

Their layout is quite close to the tabular data representation, where every row has the same set of fields.\nrow-oriented stores are most useful in scenarios when we have to access data by row, storing entire rows together\nBecause data on a persistent medium such as a disk is typically accessed block-wise a single block will contain data for all columns. This is great for cases when we’d like to access an entire user record, but makes queries accessing individual fields of multiple user records\nColumn-Oriented Data Layout\nColumn-oriented database management systems partition data vertically.Here, values for the same column are stored contiguously on disk\nColumn-oriented stores are a good fit for analytical workloads that compute aggregates, such as finding trends, computing average values, etc. Processing complex aggregates can be used in cases when logical records have multiple field\nAssume the table have id ,data and price which will be stored as below so if you want to calculate the total price it will be single disk read IO.\nSymbol: 1:DOW; 2:DOW; 3:S&amp;P; 4:S&amp;P\nDate:1:08 Aug 2018; 2:09 Aug 2018; 3:08 Aug 2018; 4:09 Aug 2018\nPrice: 1:24,314.65; 2:24,136.16; 3:2,414.45; 4:2,232.32\nIndexing\nAn index is a structure that organizes data records on disk in a way that facilitates\nefficient retrieval operations.\nThere are 2 index type\n\nPrimary index : index created by the database itself using primary key\nSecondary indexes : Created by the user based on need\n\nSecondary indexes\nMostly Secondary indexes will hold the primary key index reference and primary index will hold the address for the data in memory the advantage of using this method is if update/delete is easy because updating primary index location is fine but it need 2 lookup when we searching.\nThe way the index stored is classified in 2 types\n\nclustered index : Where the physical order of the rows in the table corresponds to the order of the index’s keys. let assume you have username filed as primary index then the data stored in data file be sorted based on username.\nnon clustered index: does not maintain the order of primary index\n\nHard Disk Drives\nOn spinning disks, seeks increase costs of random reads because they require disk rotation and mechanical head movements to position the read/write head to the desired location. However, once the expensive part is done, reading or writing contiguous bytes (i.e., sequential operations) is relatively cheap.\nThe smallest transfer unit of a spinning drive is a sector, so when some operation is\nperformed, at least an entire sector can be read or written. Sector sizes typically range\nfrom 512 bytes to 4 Kb\nSolid State Drives\nSSD is built of memory cells, connected into strings (typically 32 to 64 cells per string), strings are combined into arrays,arrays are combined into pages, and pages are combined into blocks .Blocks typically contain 64 to 512 pages.\nThe smallest unit that can be written or read is a page.\nB-Tree vs B+ Tree\nB-Trees allow storing values on any level: in root, internal, and leaf nodes.\nB+ Trees store values only in leaf nodes all operations (inserting,updating, removing, and retrieving data records) affect only leaf nodes and propagate to higher levels only during splits and merges.\nLSM tree\n\nWrite\n\nFirst it writes in WAL log and appended to an in-memory component known as the memtable.when  Mem-table became full, an Immutable MemTable was created, and a new Mem-table became empty.\nWhen Immutable Memtable is full, a FLUSH happens, dumping the “balanced tree in RAM” into a disk, called SSTable. which contains sorted values plus an index.\nSSTables are immutable, meaning once written, they are not modified. Any updates or deletes are handled by writing new SSTables with the modified data.Compaction is the process of merging and removing obsolete SSTables to reduce storage space and improve read performance.\n\nBloom Filters\n\nLSM trees often use Bloom filters to quickly check whether a key is present in the SSTables. Bloom filters are space-efficient data structures that provide a probabilistic answer to membership queries.\n\nOLTP (Online Transaction Processing) Databases\n\nOLTP databases are designed for handling transactional workloads, which involve a high volume of short, simple transactions.\nThese transactions typically involve frequent insert, update, and delete operations on individual records or small sets of records.\nOLTP databases prioritize fast response times, concurrency, and data integrity, making them suitable for applications such as e-commerce, banking, and order processing systems.\nExamples of OLTP databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nOLAP (Online Analytical Processing) Databases\n\nOLAP databases are optimized for performing complex queries and analysis on large volumes of historical data.\nThese databases are designed to support decision-making processes by providing capabilities for data aggregation, slicing, dicing, and drilling down into data to uncover insights and trends.\nOLAP databases typically store data in a denormalized format, optimizing them for analytical queries rather than transactional operations.\nOLAP databases are commonly used in business intelligence (BI), data warehousing, and reporting applications.\nExamples of OLAP databases include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Apache Hive, and Apache Spark.\n\nResources\n\nDiscover and learn about 960 database management systems\nKnowledge Base of Relational and NoSQL Database Management Systems\n\nIndepth\n\n\nmedium.com/@hnasr/following-a-database-read-to-the-metal-a187541333c2\n\n\nmedium.com/@hnasr/database-pages-a-deep-dive-38cdb2c79eb5\n\n\nHow to beat CAP theorm\nTo overcoming the CAP theorem in building data systems. It proposes a solution that involves using immutable data, rejecting incremental updates, and recomputing queries from scratch each time. This approach eliminates the complexities associated with eventual consistency.\nThe key properties of the proposed system include:\n1. Easy storage and scaling of an immutable, constantly growing dataset.\n2. Primary write operation involving adding new immutable facts of data.\n3. Recomputation of queries from raw data, avoiding the CAP theorem complexities.\n4. Use of incremental algorithms to lower query latency to an acceptable level.\nThe workflow involves storing data in flat files on HDFS, adding new data by appending files, and precomputing queries using MapReduce. The results are indexed for quick access by applications using databases like ElephantDB and Voldemort, which specialize in exporting key/value data from Hadoop for fast querying. These databases support batch writes and random reads, avoiding the complexities associated with random writes, leading to simplicity and robustness.\nGlobal secondar index\nUsed in distributed shared database where the indexing is in global so when ever request go to the DB proxy that is infront of sharded DB it will do the query on GSI to get the doc shard database ref such that we don’t want to query on all shard.**\nResources\n\nmedium.com/@hnasr/following-a-database-read-to-the-metal-a187541333c2\nBuild your own Database Index: part 1\nDatabase Fundamentals\nwww.geeknarrator.com/blog/social-posts/ten-things-about-your-database\nAdvanced Database Systems 2024 \n\nSQL\nCLient → Query enging (thread/process per client) → storage/engine (io/treads) → Disk\nthey have thread and locks and shared memory  for communication\nCassandra\nclient → MainThread pool(threads per client) →MMapedFile (kernel task) - &gt; Storage\nLocks moved to kernel"},"notes/2024/Databases":{"title":"Databases","links":["notes/2024/Distributed-System"],"tags":[],"content":"ZippyDB\nZippyDB is the largest strongly consistent, geographically distributed key-value store at Facebook.ZippyDB uses RocksDB as the underlying storage engine\nCassandra\nCassandra is a wide-column NoSQL database management system.

The cluster will be able to continue operations when some nodes fail or not able to communicate with each other.)\n\nRedis Sentinel\nThe Redis Sentinel comes up with a master-slave architecture. With this architecture, we will be able to avoid the Single point of failure which was a major concern with the Redis Standalone. Additionally, it comes up with other sets of features, which are\n\nMonitoring — constantly checking whether the Master and slave instances are working properly or not.\nNotification — Notify systems in case of failure of instances.\nAutomatic Failover — In case of a master node failure, the slave node will be promoted to master.\nConfiguration Provider — Sentinel nodes also serve as a point of discovery of the current main Redis instance.\n\nRedis server can be run in two modes:\n\nMaster Mode (Redis Master)\nSlave Mode (Redis Slave or Redis Replica)\n\nWe can configure which mode to write and read from. It is recommend to serves writes through Redis Master and reads through Redis Slaves.\nRedis Master does replicate writes to one or more Redis Slaves. The master-slave replication is done asynchronously.\nRedis is AP ( Availability and Partition Tolerance.) system.\nWhat happens when Redis Master receives write request from Client:\n\nIt does acknowledge to Client.\nRedis Master replicates the write request to 1 or more slaves. (Depends on Replication factor).\n\nHere you can see, Redis Master does not wait for replication to be completed on slaves and does acknowledgment to client immediately.\nNow lets us assume, Redis Master acknowledged to client and then got crashed. Now one of the Redis Slave (that did not receive the write) will get promoted to Redis Master, loosing the write forever.\nIn Redis, the automatic promotion of a slave (now called a replica) to master upon the master’s failure does not happen automatically by default. However, you can achieve automatic failover using Redis Sentinel, which is designed to monitor your Redis servers and handle automatic promotion when the master fails.\nRedis Persistence Models\n\nNo persistence\nRDB Files: The RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.\nAOF (Append Only File):The AOF persistence logs every write operation the server receives that will be played again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset.\n\nHow redis doing snapshot with single thread\nRedis leverages forking and copy-on-write to enable efficient data persistence. Forking creates a new process (child) that shares memory with the original (parent) process. Redis, which manages large amounts of memory, uses this mechanism to snapshot data without consuming additional memory unless changes are made. Through copy-on-write, memory pages are only duplicated when modified, allowing the child process to work with a consistent snapshot while keeping memory usage low. This approach enables Redis to capture snapshots of gigabytes of memory quickly and efficiently.\n\nAtomic Operations: Every Redis command is atomic, meaning that when a command is executing, other commands cannot interrupt it. This ensures data correctness, even with multiple clients connected to the Redis server.\n\nThis atomicity is especially beneficial for operations like incrementing values, as it avoids concurrency issues where multiple clients trying to increment a value simultaneously could lead to incorrect results.\n\n\nIn-Memory Data Storage: Redis stores data in memory, making it extremely fast for read and write operations. This is why Redis is often used as a cache.\n\nHowever, Redis also offers configurable persistence options to prevent data loss in case of a crash. These options include:\n\nPeriodic Disk Dumping: Data is periodically written to disk without deleting it from memory. Upon restarting, Redis loads the last dump.\nWrite-Ahead Logging (AOF): Every update command is logged to an append-only file, allowing for data reconstruction.\nAsynchronous Replication: Data is replicated to another Redis server.\n\n\n\n\nSingle-Threaded Event Loop: Redis utilizes a single-threaded event loop for handling concurrent client requests, unlike multi-threaded approaches commonly used in databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.\n\nRedis’s Approach: Redis leverages the fact that network I/O operations (like reading data from a socket) are generally slow compared to in-memory operations. It uses IO multiplexing to efficiently monitor multiple sockets and only reads data when it’s available, avoiding unnecessary blocking.\n\nThis approach allows Redis to handle many concurrent connections on a single thread, as it spends minimal time waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n\n\nSpeed and Simplicity: The single-threaded model, combined with in-memory data storage, makes Redis extremely fast. By avoiding multi-threading complexities, Redis also maintains code simplicity and reduces the risk of concurrency-related bugs.\n\n\n\nStarRocks\nStarRocks is an open-source, OLAP (analytics-focused) database that’s designed for running low-latency queries on data in real-time\nInflux DB\nInfluxDB is an open-source time-series database designed to handle high write and query loads for time-stamped data it uses column oriented\nConcepts\nStroage Engine : LevelDB\n7gy8H2ZmWzcb0YrWhzlbksyB9vkJjdp8mGvj6trn-USBhYFuf8ZMhQbPsI2fHcQoUOKGUA0WMtlKRmW48K04oQ==\n\nInfluxDB is schemaless, there is still a conceptual schema that includes:\n\nMeasurement: We’ll have a measurement called “environment” to represent the environmental data recorded by the sensors.\nTag sets: We’ll use tags to identify each room.

Each Creator had a unique way of bringing toys to life, showcasing various creational design patterns.\n\n\nAbstract Factory Pattern: The Artisan Workshop\nIn the heart of Toyland, there was an Artisan Workshop where the master toymaker, the Abstract Artisan, crafted a variety of toys. Depending on the season – be it spring, summer, fall, or winter – the Artisan would use a specialized machine to create toys that matched the spirit of that season. The workshop could seamlessly switch between crafting delightful flower-shaped puzzles in spring to building snowflake-adorned snow globes in winter.\nDesign Pattern Explanation: The Abstract Factory pattern is like the Artisan Workshop, creating toys that match the theme of each season using a specialized machine.\n\n\nclass SeasonalToyFactory {\n    createToy() {\n        throw new Error(&quot;Abstract method.

Children from Toyland could visit the shop and choose the parts they wanted for their custom toy – selecting the type of body, color, and accessories. The Builder Elf would then assemble the chosen parts, creating a unique toy tailored to each child’s preferences.\nDesign Pattern Explanation: The Builder pattern is like the Custom Toy Shop, where a toymaker assembles a toy based on the specific choices made by the children.\n\n\nclass CustomToyBuilder {\n    constructor() {\n        this.toy = new Toy();\n    }\n \n    buildBody(body) {\n        this.toy.setBody(body);\n    }\n \n    buildColor(color) {\n        this.toy.setColor(color);\n    }\n \n    buildAccessories(accessories) {\n        this.toy.setAccessories(accessories);\n    }\n \n    getToy() {\n        return this.toy;\n    }\n}\n \n\n\nFactory Method Pattern: The Animal Wonderland Factory\nA bit further away, there was an Animal Wonderland Factory. Here, the Animal Creator designed a variety of stuffed animals, each with its own special feature.

Every day, the Animal Creator would decide which adorable animal to make and use the corresponding machine.\nDesign Pattern Explanation: The Factory Method pattern is like the Animal Wonderland Factory, where different machines create various stuffed animals based on the decision of the Animal Creator.\n\n\nclass AnimalCreator {\n    createAnimal() {\n        throw new Error(&quot;Abstract method.

The museum had a magical guardian, the Singleton Guardian, who ensured there was only one entrance to the museum. No matter how many children wanted to enter, they all had to go through the same door, preserving the uniqueness and timelessness of the exhibited toys.\nDesign Pattern Explanation: The Singleton pattern is like the Timeless Toy Museum, where the Singleton Guardian ensures there’s only one entrance, maintaining the uniqueness and timelessness of the exhibited toys.\n\n\nclass SingletonGuardian {\n    static #instance;\n \n    constructor() {\n        if (!SingletonGuardian.#instance) {\n            SingletonGuardian.#instance = this;\n        }\n \n        return SingletonGuardian.#instance;\n    }\n}\n \n\n\nPrototype Pattern: The Replicator’s Workshop\nNestled on the outskirts of Toyland, there was the Replicator’s Workshop. Here, the Prototype Puppeteer, a wizard with a magical wand, had the ability to duplicate toys effortlessly. When a special toy was created, the Puppeteer would wave their wand, and presto – an exact replica would appear! This allowed for the mass production of popular toys without starting from scratch each time.\nDesign Pattern Explanation: The Prototype pattern is like the Replicator’s Workshop, where the Prototype Puppeteer magically duplicates toys, making exact copies without crafting each one from the beginning.\n\n\nclass Toy {\n    clone() {\n        return Object.assign(Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(this)), this);\n    }\n}\n \nclass PrototypePuppeteer {\n    makeDuplicate(originalToy) {\n        return originalToy.clone();\n    }\n}\n \nStructural Design Patterns:\nIn the charming town of Toyland, where toys came to life, there was an ingenious architect named StructureBuilder. StructureBuilder loved designing magical playhouses using various structural design patterns, each contributing to the uniqueness and durability of the toy structures.\n\n\nAdapter Pattern: The Magical Toy Connector\nOne day, the StructureBuilder wanted to connect a set of new magnetic building blocks with the existing wooden ones. To make them work together seamlessly, the architect created a Magical Toy Connector. This connector translated the language of magnets into the language of wooden pegs, allowing different types of building blocks to connect effortlessly.\nclass WoodenBlock {\n    insertIntoSlot() {\n        // Insert into a wooden slot\n    }\n}\n \nclass MagneticBlock {\n    attachWithMagnet() {\n        // Attach with a magnet\n    }\n}\n \nclass MagicalToyConnector {\n    connectWoodenToMagnetic(woodenBlock, magneticBlock) {\n        woodenBlock.insertIntoSlot();\n        magneticBlock.attachWithMagnet();\n    }\n}\n\n\nBridge Pattern: The Enchanted Rope Bridge\nStructureBuilder wanted to create an enchanting rope bridge connecting two treehouses. Using the Bridge pattern, the architect separated the abstraction of the bridge from its implementation. Now, whether it was a magical vine or a sparkling thread, it could be easily swapped without affecting the overall structure.\nclass RopeBridge {\n    constructor(implementation) {\n        this.implementation = implementation;\n    }\n \n    crossBridge() {\n        this.implementation.cross();\n    }\n}\n \nclass MagicalVineBridge {\n    cross() {\n        // Cross the bridge using magical vines\n    }\n}\n \nclass SparklingThreadBridge {\n    cross() {\n        // Cross the bridge using sparkling threads\n    }\n\n\nComposite Pattern: The Tower of Imagination\nThe StructureBuilder dreamt of creating a Tower of Imagination using a variety of building blocks. With the Composite pattern, individual blocks and complex structures could be treated uniformly. The Tower of Imagination could have both simple blocks and other towers as its components, forming a magnificent and unified structure.\nclass BuildingBlock {\n    build() {\n        // Build the block\n    }\n}\n \nclass TowerOfImagination {\n    constructor() {\n        this.components = [];\n    }\n \n    addComponent(component) {\n        this.components.push(component);\n    }\n \n    build() {\n        for (const component of this.components) {\n            component.build();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nDecorator Pattern: The Colorful Paintbrush\nStructureBuilder wanted to add vibrant colors to a plain wooden carousel. Instead of modifying the carousel directly, the architect used the Decorator pattern. A ColorDecorator wrapped around the carousel, adding a burst of colors without altering its underlying structure.\nclass Carousel {\n    spin() {\n        // Spin the carousel\n    }\n}\n \nclass ColorDecorator {\n    constructor(carousel, color) {\n        this.carousel = carousel;\n        this.color = color;\n    }\n \n    spin() {\n        this.carousel.spin();\n        this.addColor();\n    }\n \n    addColor() {\n        // Add the chosen color to the carousel\n    }\n}\n\n\nProxy Pattern\nThe proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. For instance, managing access to an object that is expensive to instantiate.\n\n\nclass AuthProxy {\n  constructor(user, service) {\n      this.user = user;\n      this.service = service;\n  }\n\n  performAction() {\n      if (this.user.hasAccess) {\n          this.service.performAction();\n      } else {\n          console.log(&quot;Access denied: You do not have permission to perform this action.&quot;);\n      }\n  }\n}\n\nconst user = { name: &quot;John&quot;, hasAccess: false };\nconst realService = new RealService();\nconst proxy = new AuthProxy(user, realService);\n\nproxy.performAction();\n\n\n\nFacade Pattern: The Magic Toy Workshop\nIn the heart of Toyland, StructureBuilder established the Magic Toy Workshop, a place of enchantment where various toys were crafted. To simplify the complexity of the toy-making process, StructureBuilder implemented the Facade pattern. The Magic Toy Workshop acted as a facade, providing a single entry point for creating different types of toys.\nclass MagicToyWorkshop {\n    createTeddyBear() {\n        // Create a teddy bear\n    }\n \n    createDoll() {\n        // Create a doll\n    }\n \n    createToyCar() {\n        // Create a toy car\n    }\n}\n\n\nFlyweight Pattern\nThe Flyweight Pattern is useful because it helps reduce memory consumption and improve performance by sharing common parts of objects across multiple instances.\nA text editor might contain millions of characters with different fonts, styles, and sizes. By using the Flyweight Pattern, the editor can share common glyphs and styles across characters, reducing memory usage.\n\n\nclass FontStyle {\n    constructor(font, size, color) {\n        this.font = font;\n        this.size = size;\n        this.color = color;\n    }\n}\n\nclass FontFactory {\n    constructor() {\n        this.styles = {};\n    }\n\n    getFontStyle(font, size, color) {\n        const key = `${font}-${size}-${color}`;\n        if (!this.styles[key]) {\n            this.styles[key] = new FontStyle(font, size, color);\n        }\n        return this.styles[key];\n    }\n}\n\n// Client code\nconst factory = new FontFactory();\n\nconst style1 = factory.getFontStyle(&#039;Arial&#039;, 12, &#039;Black&#039;);\nconst style2 = factory.getFontStyle(&#039;Arial&#039;, 12, &#039;Black&#039;);  // Reused\n\nconsole.log(style1 === style2);\n"},"notes/2024/Distributed-System":{"title":"Distributed System","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"CRDT\nCRDT stands for Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type. It’s a type of data structure designed for distributed systems where multiple replicas of data exist across different nodes, and these replicas can be modified independently.\nResources\nquorum-based protocol\nThe quorum-based protocol is the key to reaching a consensus on a value within a distributed database. You’ve two quorums:\n\n\nThe Read Quorum: When a client wants to read data, it needs to receive responses from a certain number of zones (known as the read quorum). This is to make sure that it gets the most up-to-date data.\n\n\nThe Write Quorum: When the client wants to write data, it must receive acknowledgment from a certain number of zones to make sure that the data is written to a majority of the zones.\n\n\nRaft Consensus Protocol\nRaft is a consensus protocol designed for distributed systems, particularly for achieving consensus in a fault-tolerant manner. It’s widely used in modern distributed systems, including cloud-native applications, databases, and file systems.\nWhat is Consensus?\nIn a distributed system, consensus refers to the process of agreeing on a single value or state among multiple nodes or replicas. This is crucial in ensuring data consistency and availability, even in the presence of failures or network partitions.\nRaft Consensus Protocol:\nRaft is a consensus protocol developed by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout in 2013. It’s designed to be more understandable, scalable, and fault-tolerant than its predecessors, such as Paxos.\nRaft works by electing a leader node, which is responsible for managing the replication of data across the cluster. The protocol ensures that the leader node is always up-to-date and that all nodes agree on the same state.\nKey Components:\n\nLeader Node: The leader node is responsible for managing the replication of data and ensuring consistency across the cluster.\nFollower Nodes: Follower nodes replicate the data from the leader node and participate in the consensus process.\nTerm: A term is a period of time during which a leader node is elected and serves the cluster.\nLog: The log is a sequence of entries that represent the state of the system. Each entry is assigned a unique index and term.\n\nRaft Protocol Steps:\n\nLeader Election: Nodes in the cluster vote for a leader node. The node with the most votes becomes the leader.\nLog Replication: The leader node replicates its log to the follower nodes.\nHeartbeats: The leader node sends periodic heartbeats to the follower nodes to maintain its leadership.\nLog Consistency: Follower nodes verify the consistency of their logs with the leader node’s log.\nConflict Resolution: In case of conflicts, the leader node resolves them by rolling back the conflicting entries and re-applying the correct ones.\n\nRaft’s Advantages:\n\nFault Tolerance: Raft can tolerate up to (n-1)/2 node failures, where n is the total number of nodes in the cluster.\nScalability: Raft is designed to scale horizontally, making it suitable for large distributed systems.\nUnderstandability: Raft’s design is more intuitive and easier to understand than other consensus protocols.\n\nResources\n\nwww.allthingsdistributed.com/ [_Werner Vogels on building scalable and robust distributed systems]\nmuratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2020/06/learning-about-distributed-systems.html _\nwww.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/\n\nTools to monitor\n\nStatsD is originally a simple daemon developed and released by Etsy to aggregate and summarize application metrics\n\nProduct [sass]\n\ndapr.io/\n"},"notes/2024/Distributed-tracing":{"title":"Distributed tracing","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tools\n\nodigos.io/ Simplify OpenTelemetry complexity and eliminate performance overhead with the only platform that can generate distributed tracing across all your applications without code changes.\nSigNoz is an open-source observability platform native to OpenTelemetry with logs, traces and metrics in a single application.

The daemon communicates with containerd via a CRUD-style API over gRPC to create container\n\n\ncontainerd cannot actually create containers. It uses runc to do that.

BuildKit is the build engine that solves the build steps in a Dockerfile to produce a container image or other artifacts.\nStarting from Docker 18.09, BuildKit is included\nBuildKit is an advanced and modular container image building tool that is part of the Docker ecosystem. It is designed to improve the performance, flexibility, and security of building container images. BuildKit introduces features like parallelization, caching improvements, and the ability to use custom frontends, which allows for more efficient and customizable image building processes.\nwe need to enable it explicitly. You can do this by setting the DOCKER_BUILDKIT environment variable to 1. export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . —no-cache → this cmd use the docker build kit and pull the layer parallely and faster then normal build. you can see the build output is running parallely\nTo create a multi-platform Docker image that can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, you can use the buildx command,**docker buildx build -t your-app-image --platform linux/amd64,windows/amd64,darwin/amd64 .**\nBefore buildKit when we building docker image by setting cwd . the hole repo will send to docker engine expect docker ingore file but in buildkit the engine will request for the file it needed\nIn docker desktop default it use builkit.\nFeatures in buildKit\n\nMount\nCustom front end where we can use go language and other supported language to write the docker file\n\nImages\nImages are made up of multiple layers that get stacked on top of each other and represented as a single object.\nA Docker image is just a bunch of loosely-connected read-only layers. To inspect the image with the docker image inspect command\ndocker image inspect ubuntu:latest\n\nWill print all layers in the image\n\nDocker employs a storage driver (snapshotter in newer versions) that is responsible for stacking layers and presenting them as a single unified filesystem. Examples of storage drivers on Linux include AUFS , overlay2 , devicemapper , btrfs and zfs . As their names suggest, each one is based on a Linux filesystem or block-device technology, and each has its own unique performance characteristics.\nSharing image layers:  If we downloading the image and that has base layer is unbuntu which we already have it will reuse it\ndigests of images: Every time you pull an image, the docker image pull command will include the image’s digest (cryptographic content hash) as part of the return code. You can also view the digests of images in your Docker host’s local repository by adding the —digests flag to the docker image ls command\ndistribution hash: When we pushing and pulling image to hub we send the layer in compressed manner. which cause the image digest to change so we use distribution hash. which is hash value of compressed image\ndangling images: A dangling image is an image that is no longer tagged, and appears in listings as none:none to get docker image ls --filter dangling=true\nmanifest list: User may have different architectures, such as Windows, ARM, and s390x. so when we pulling the image with tag we need to download the our architectures suitable image for that we use manifest list\nmanifest list contain entries for each architecture the image supports with same tag.\nWhen we pull an image, your Docker client makes the relevant calls to the Docker Registry API running on Docker Hub. If a manifest list exists for the image, it will be parsed to see if an entry exists for Linux on ARM. If an ARM entry exists, the manifest for that image is retrieved and parsed for the crypto ID’s of the layers that make up the image. Each layer is then pulled from Docker Hub’s\nArgs\nContainers\nA container is the runtime instance of an image. docker container run image --name\nStopping containers gracefully: Docker container stop sends a SIGTERM signal to the PID 1 process inside of the container. As we just said, this gives the process a chance to clean things up and gracefully shut itself down.If it doesn’t exit within 10 seconds, it will receive a SIGKILL.\nSelf-healing containers with restart policies: The following restart policies exist\n\nalways  Will restart the container once docker is resarting (systemlctl restart docker)\nunless-stopped\non-failed will restart a container if it exits with a non-zero exit code\n\nContainerizing an App\n# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image\nFROM node:14\n \n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\n \n# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container\nCOPY package*.json ./\n \n# Install the application dependencies\nRUN npm install\n \n# Copy the application code to the container\nCOPY . .\n \n# Expose the port the app runs on\nEXPOSE 3000\n \n# Define the command to run your application\nCMD [&quot;node&quot;, &quot;app.js&quot;]\n\ndocker build -t app-image .\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 -d app-image\n\nMemory &amp; CPU Constraints\n\nBy default it take the host cpu and memory as much it need\ndocker run —-memory 60m my-image:tag 60Mb limit\nDocker have OOM killer (out of memory killer) which is enabled by default what it do was when ever the container is getting out of memory it wil the process that consume more memory to disable the OOM docker run -m 128m --oom-kill-disable my-image:tag\nSwap: Swap is an extension of physical memory (RAM) that allows the operating system to use a portion of the disk as if it were additional RAM. docker run --memory=512m --memory-swap=1g my_container\nswap space is typically enabled by default. This means that the operating system may use swap space to store less frequently accessed data when the physical memory (RAM) is fully utilized.\nIf we set memory and swap same it won’t use swap\nNote: Swap may downgrad the performance of the host\ndocker run --cpus .5 my-image:tag can use only 50% of the CPU\ndocker run —-cpuset-cpus 1,2 my-image:tag allocate the 2nd and 3rd CPU\n\nEnviroment Var\n\ndocker run -e VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value my_container\ndocker inspect --format=&#039;{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}&#039; container_id to inspect the environment variables of a running container.\n\nLogs\n\ndocker logs [container_name_or_id]\ndocker events —-since ‘5m’\ndocker logs -f my-container follow logs\ndocker run -D  Run in debugging mode\n\nNetworking\nDocker networking comprises three major components:\n\nThe Container Network Model (CNM) →is a specification that defines how container runtimes like Docker should provide networking for containers.\nlibnetwork →is the library that implements the CNM specifications. It’s written in Go, and implements the core components outlined in the CNM.\nDrivers →drivers are plugins that implement the CNM specifications through libnetwork\n\nThe Container Network Model (CNM)\nit defines three building blocks\n\nSandboxes →is an isolated network stack. It includes; Ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables, and DNS config.\nEndpoints→are virtual network interfaces (E.g. veth ). Like normal network interfaces, they’re responsible for making connections. In the case of the CNM, it’s the job of the endpoint to connect a sandbox to a network.\nNetworks →are a software implementation of an 802.1d bridge (more commonly known as a switch). As such, they group together, and isolate, a collection of endpoints that need to communicate.\n\nDrivers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriverDescriptionbridgeThe default network driver.hostRemove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.noneCompletely isolate a container from the host and other containers.overlayOverlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together.ipvlanIPvlan networks provide full control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.macvlanAssign a MAC address to a container.\nBy default docker have bridge network(in windows it called NAT) which assign a unique ip address for each container from the range of 172.17.0.0/16\nThe default “bridge” network, on all Linux-based Docker hosts, maps to an underlying Linux bridge in the kernel called “docker0”  docker network inspect bridge | grep bridge.name \nto check the docker network inspect (docker network inspect bridge) the container.\nHow to make two docker to communicate among them\n\nCreate a network docker network create -d nat localnet\nRun two container on same network docker container run --network localnet name\nCommunicate with docker name in container ping containername1\n\nNote: The default bridge network on Linux does not support name resolution via the Docker DNS service.\nbridge Network\nwe can create a custom bridge using docker create network name which will create the new netowork bind with bridge and allocate the new Ip range and if you want the container to run on this network attach with —network=name\nHost Network\nIt directly bind the container to host and exposed to access publicly docker run --network host name we can access this by host IP.\nMACVLAN\nConnect the container interface through to the hosts interface.it requires the host NIC to be in promiscuous mode (isn’t allowed on most public cloud platforms)\nCommunication between two container in same region\nWhen you send a packet to 172.23.2.1 on your local network, your operating system (Linux, for our purposes) looks up the MAC address for that IP address in a table it maintains (called the ARP table). Then it puts that MAC address on the packet and sends it off.\nSo! What if I had a packet for the container 10.4.4.4 but I actually wanted it to go to the computer 172.23.1.1 where another container is running?. You just add an entry to another table. It’s all tables.\nHere’s command you could run to do this manually:\nsudo ip route add 10.4.4.0/24 via 172.23.1.1 dev eth0\n\nip route add adds an entry to the route table on your computer. This route table entry says “Linux, whenever you see a packet for 10.4.4.*, just send it to the MAC address for 172.23.2.1,\nCommunication between two container in different region\nroute table trick will only work if the computers are connected directly. If the two computers are far apart (in different local networks) we’ll need to do something more complicated.\nWe want to send a packet to the container IP 10.4.4.4, and it is on the computer 172.9.9.9. But because the computer is far away, we have to address the packet to the IP address 172.9.9.9. Woe is us! All is lost! Where are we going to put the IP address 10.4.4.4?\nEncapsulation\nAll is not lost. We can do a thing called “encapsulation”. This is where you take a network packet and put it inside ANOTHER network packet.\nSo instead of sending\nIP: 10.4.4.4\nTCP stuff\nHTTP stuff\n\nwe will send\nIP: 172.9.9.9\n(extra wrapper stuff)\nIP: 10.4.4.4\nTCP stuff\nHTTP stuff\n\nThere are at least 2 different ways of doing encapsulation: there’s “ip-in-ip” and “vxlan” encapsulation.\nvxlan encapsulation takes your whole packet (including the MAC address) and wraps it inside a UDP packet. That looks like this:\nMAC address: 11:11:11:11:11:11\nIP: 172.9.9.9\nUDP port 8472 (the &quot;vxlan port&quot;)\nMAC address: ab:cd:ef:12:34:56\nIP: 10.4.4.4\nTCP port 80\nHTTP stuff\n\nip-in-ip encapsulation just slaps on an extra IP header on top of your old IP header.

Volumes are decoupled from containers, meaning you create and manage them separately, and they’re not tied to the lifecycle of any container. Net result, you can delete a container with a volume, and the volume will not be deleted.\ndocker volume create myvol\ndocker volume inspect myvol\n[\n\t{\n\t\t&quot;CreatedAt&quot;: &quot;2018-01-12T12:12:10Z&quot;,\n\t\t&quot;Driver&quot;: &quot;local&quot;,\n\t\t&quot;Labels&quot;: {},\n\t\t&quot;Mountpoint&quot;: &quot;/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data&quot;,\n\t\t&quot;Name&quot;: &quot;myvol&quot;,\n\t\t&quot;Options&quot;: {},\n\t\t&quot;Scope&quot;: &quot;local&quot;\n\t}\n]\n \n\nMountpoint → where the data will be stored\n\nBy default, Docker creates new volumes with the built-in local driver. As the name suggests, local volumes are only available to containers on the node they’re created on. Use the -d flag to specify a different driver. Third-party drivers are available as plugins. These can provide advanced storage features, and integrate external storage systems with Docker\nTypes\n\nHost volume → we explicitly tell the host path and container path\nAnonymous voulme → we only tell the container path it will automatically mount the data to /var/lib/docker/volumes/random_hash/data\nNamed volume → Create volume using docker volume create myvol and attach it when running docker run -v myvol:path_in_container\n\ndocker run —name myapp -p 4000:4000 -v full_path_in_current_host:path_in_docker run imagename\nwe can use this to avoid rebuiliding the images for each file change in our code we can directly mount the current code dir to docker container which will help to avoid building again and again. use this only for dev.\nMultistage Build\nThis will be used to reduce the size of docker image by removing the unwanted things that no need for running the appliaction.let us assume you have program that can be compiled in to bin so we don’t need the things that we used during building the program.\nExample : In nodejs typescript code we no need the src code after compilling in to js so we can just copy the necessary file and remove other things.\n# Stage 1: Build Stage\nFROM node:latest AS build\n \nWORKDIR /app\n \n# Copy package.json and package-lock.json\nCOPY package*.json ./\n \n# Install dependencies\nRUN npm install\n \n# Copy source code\nCOPY . .\n \n# Build the application\nRUN npm run build\n \n# Stage 2: Production Stage (new base layer)\n#FROM will start a new base layer old will be ingored\nFROM nginx:latest\n \n# Copy built files from the build stage to the production image \n#(the above will be considered as seprate image and removed)\nCOPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html\n \n# Other configurations, if needed\n \n# Container startup command for the web server (nginx in this case)\nCMD [&quot;nginx&quot;, &quot;-g&quot;, &quot;daemon off;&quot;]\ndocker image history image name → to print all layers and how it was builded\nSecurity\nScanning for vulernablity\n\nTrivy: Lightweight and easy to use.\nClair: Part of the CoreOS project, designed for container scanning.\nDagda: Extensive vulnerability scanner for Docker containers.\nAnchore: Provides detailed analysis and policy enforcement.\ndocker scan &lt;image_name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt; part of Docker Hub and is designed to analyze Docker images for security vulnerabilities.\n\nDocker Compose\nIt was a Python tool (v1) that sat on top of Docker, and allowed you to define entire multi-container apps in a single YAML file. now v3 written in GO\nversion:3\nservices:\n  web: #name for the container\n    build: . \n\t\t#context if we have docker file give the path here and not give image\n\t\timage: imagename\n\t\tenviroment:\n\t\t\t\tDB_URL: value\n    ports:\n      - &quot;8000:5000&quot;\n    volumes:\n      - .:/code  #(map current dir (.) to the /code dir in container)\n    depends_on:\n      - redis #will wait for redis to spin up\n\t\trestart: always\n \n  redis:\n    image: redis\n \nCompose file Structure\n\nversion: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file syntax. It ensures compatibility and defines which features are available. ****\nServices Describes the containers that make up the application, specifying their configuration, links, and other details.\n\nimage: Specifies the Docker image to use for the service. It can be an official image from a registry or a custom image.\nbuild: Defines the build context for the service, allowing you to build a custom image from a Dockerfile.\nports: Maps container ports to host ports, allowing external access to the service.\nvolumes: Mounts volumes from the host or other containers into the service, providing persistent storage.\nenvironment: Sets environment variables for the service, influencing its runtime behavior.\ndepends_on: Specifies dependencies between services, ensuring one service starts only after its dependencies are up.\nnetworks: Connects the service to specific networks, facilitating communication with other services.\ncommand: Overrides the default command specified in the Docker image, allowing custom command execution.\nentrypoint: Similar to command, but it specifies the entry point for the container.\nrestart: Defines the restart policy for the service, determining how the container behaves after it exits.\n\n\nnetworks Defines networks that containers can connect to. This allows you to isolate containers or facilitate communication between them.\nvolumes: Declares named volumes that can be mounted into containers. Volumes persist data beyond the lifetime of a container.\nconfigs: Specifies configuration files for services. It allows you to manage configuration separately from the Compose file.\nsecrets: Defines secrets that can be used by services. It helps manage sensitive data securely.\nextensions: Provides a way to extend the Compose file by referencing external Compose files.\n\nDocker compose CMDs\n\ndocker-compose up: Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers as per the configuration defined in the docker-compose.yml file.\ndocker-compose down: Stops and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by docker-compose up.\ndocker-compose build: Builds or rebuilds services specified in the docker-compose.yml file. it will build all images with prefix with name of directory\ndocker-compose ps: Lists the running containers associated with the Docker Compose configuration.\ndocker-compose logs: Displays log output from services.

Which components did you build? Was there some useful insight like “wait, we can cut scope and do what we want by doing way less work” that you came up with?)\n\n- The impact of the project – who was it for?

They help prevent conflicts and misunderstandings when working on large, complex systems.\nEntities and Value Objects\nEntities are objects with distinct identities that are defined by their attributes. Value Objects, on the other hand, are objects defined by their attributes but without a distinct identity. They represent concepts like dates, money, or geographical coordinates.\nAggregates\nAggregates are groups of related Entities and Value Objects treated as a single unit. They enforce consistency and transactional boundaries within the domain.\nThe Repository Pattern\nThe Repository pattern is a design pattern that acts as an abstraction layer between your domain model and the data access code. It provides a set of methods for querying and manipulating domain objects without exposing the underlying data store (such as a database or web service)\nTactical Design Patterns\nthree fundamental building blocks: Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates\n Entities\nEntities are objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. Think of them as nouns in your domain. Entities are often the most critical elements within your domain model. They have a lifecycle and can change over time while preserving their identity.\nIn E-commerce customer is entites\nValue Objects\nValue Objects represent concepts like dates, money, addresses, and more. They are immutable, meaning their attributes cannot change once set.\nAggregates\nare clusters of related Entities and Value Objects treated as a single unit. They ensure transactional consistency within a part of your domain.\nExample : An “Order” Aggregate could include the Order Entity as the Aggregate Root and related Order Items as Entities or Value Objects.\n\n\nEntities:\n\nDefinition: Entities are objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. They are typically mutable and are defined by their attributes.\nExample: In an e-commerce system, a “Customer” could be an entity. The identity of a customer persists even if their information, such as the shipping address, changes.\nConsiderations:\n\nEntities should be identifiable by a unique identifier.\nChanges to the state of an entity are significant and affect its identity.\nBusiness rules often revolve around entities.\n\n\n\n\n\nValue Objects:\n\nDefinition: Value Objects are objects without a distinct identity; they are defined by their attributes. They are immutable and represent a descriptive aspect of the domain.\nExample: A “Money” value object representing a specific amount in a certain currency. The key here is that the value itself is what matters, not any inherent identity.\nConsiderations:\n\nEquality of value objects is determined by the equality of their attributes.\nThey should be immutable; any change results in a new instance.\nThey represent concepts rather than individual entities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregates:\n\nDefinition: Aggregates are clusters of entities and value objects treated as a single unit. They have a root entity that serves as the entry point for interactions with the rest of the aggregate.\nExample: In an e-commerce system, an “Order” could be an aggregate consisting of entities like “Customer,” “Product,” and value objects like “OrderItem.”\nConsiderations:\n\nThe root entity ensures consistency and controls access to the aggregate.\nAggregates encapsulate business rules that involve multiple entities.\nChanges within an aggregate are transactionally consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to decide:\n\nIdentity and Mutability:\n\nIf identity is crucial, and the object’s state changes significantly, it is likely an entity.\nIf the emphasis is on the attributes’ value, and changes result in a new instance, it is likely a value object.\n\n\nTransactional Consistency:\n\nIf a group of objects needs to be treated as a single unit regarding consistency, they should be part of the same aggregate.\n\n\nBusiness Rules:\n\nEntities often encapsulate business rules specific to them.\nAggregates encapsulate business rules involving multiple entities.\n\n\n\nExample:\nLet’s consider an online shopping scenario:\n\n\nEntities:\n\n“Customer” (with a unique identifier, mutable attributes).\n“Product” (with a unique identifier, mutable attributes).\n\n\n\nValue Objects:\n\n“Price” (immutable, defined by amount and currency).\n“Address” (immutable, defined by street, city, etc.).\n\n\n\nAggregates:\n\n“Order” (root entity, consists of “Customer,” “Product,” “Price,” and “Address”).\n\nEnsures that changes to the order are transactionally consistent.\nManages business rules related to the order.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy carefully considering the nature of objects and their relationships, you can model your domain effectively using Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates in a way that reflects the real-world scenario you’re addressing.\nDomain Services and Factories\nChapter Four.

This feature gives you fine-grained control over shard placement based on node attributes and conditions, helping you optimize data distribution, resource utilization, and cluster stability.\nHere’s an explanation of index-level shard allocation filtering:\nScenario: Consider a multi-node Elasticsearch cluster where each node has different hardware specifications or specific roles, such as hot, warm, or cold data nodes. You want to ensure that certain indices are allocated only to nodes that meet specific criteria.\nNode Attributes:\nElasticsearch allows you to assign custom attributes to nodes in your cluster. These attributes can describe node characteristics such as hardware capabilities, roles, geographic location, or any other relevant information.\nIndex Settings:\nYou can define shard allocation rules at the index level using index settings. Specifically, you can use the index.routing.allocation.include and index.routing.allocation.exclude settings to specify conditions that nodes must meet or avoid in order to be eligible for storing the shards of a particular index.\n\nindex.routing.allocation.include: This setting specifies conditions that nodes must meet to be eligible for shard allocation. For example, you can include nodes with specific attributes, roles, or other criteria.\nindex.routing.allocation.exclude: This setting specifies conditions that nodes must avoid to be eligible for shard allocation. It allows you to exclude nodes based on attributes, roles, or other criteria.\n\nExample:\nLet’s say you have an Elasticsearch cluster with nodes tagged with attributes like “datacenter” and “node_type,” and you want to ensure that a particular index, “logs,” is only allocated to nodes in the “us-west” datacenter with the “hot” node type.\nPUT /logs/_settings\n{\n  &quot;settings&quot;: {\n    &quot;index.routing.allocation.include.datacenter&quot;: &quot;us-west&quot;,\n    &quot;index.routing.allocation.include.node_type&quot;: &quot;hot&quot;\n  }\n}\n \nIn this example:\n\nThe index.routing.allocation.include.datacenter setting ensures that shards of the “logs” index will be allocated only to nodes in the “us-west” datacenter.\nThe index.routing.allocation.include.node_type setting further restricts allocation to nodes with the “hot” node type.\n\nBy applying these index-level shard allocation filtering settings, you can control where your data is stored based on your cluster’s node attributes and criteria. This helps you optimize resource utilization, balance workloads, and ensure that data is placed on nodes that meet specific requirements for your use case.\nArray of objects are stored as seprate\nIn Lucene, arrays of objects are stored by flattening them into a sequence of individual terms. Lucene doesn’t natively support complex nested structures like arrays of objects or nested arrays as you would find in some other document-oriented databases. Instead, Lucene is designed to work with flat fields, and it treats arrays of objects as a collection of separate terms.\n{\n      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The Great Book&quot;,\n      &quot;authors&quot;: [\n        {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Author 1&quot;, &quot;country&quot;: &quot;USA&quot;},\n        {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Author 2&quot;, &quot;country&quot;: &quot;UK&quot;}\n      ]\n}\n\nThe “authors” field would be indexed as multiple terms, with each term representing one author object. For example:\n\n[authors.name]: [“Author 1”, “Author 2”]\nauthors.country: [“USA”, “UK”]\n\nIndex patterns\nIndex patterns are a fundamental concept when working with Kibana, as they allow you to search, analyze, and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch.\nAn index pattern specifies a wildcard pattern that matches one or more Elasticsearch indices. Indices are where your data is stored in Elasticsearch. By defining an index pattern, you determine the scope of data that Kibana will work with.\nIndex life cycle mangement\nGET /my-index-000001/_ilm/explain → to get llm\nPOST /my-index-000001/_ilm/retry → to retry the index\nAliases →An alias is a secondary name for a group of data streams or indices. Most Elasticsearch APIs accept an alias in place of a data stream or index name. it used when the index is rollover it write the old data in this index name and new data will come to the old name.\nIndex templates\nthat defines settings, mappings, and other index-related configurations for newly created indices that match a specified pattern or criteria. Index templates are useful when you want to ensure consistent settings and mappings for indices created dynamically or periodically, such as daily or monthly time-based indices.\nHow to Create templates\nPUT /_template/my_template\n    {\n     // Match indices starting with &quot;log-&quot; then apply this template\n      &quot;index_patterns&quot;: [&quot;log-*&quot;], \n    \n      &quot;settings&quot;: {\n        &quot;number_of_shards&quot;: 1,\n        &quot;number_of_replicas&quot;: 1\n      },\n      &quot;mappings&quot;: {\n        &quot;properties&quot;: {\n          &quot;timestamp&quot;: {\n            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\n          },\n          &quot;message&quot;: {\n            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;\n          },\n          // Other field mappings\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nReindexing\nblog.stackademic.com/optimizing-elasticsearch-reindex-without-downtime-0f70cb4949d6\nConcurrent updates on documents\nElasticsearch uses a versioning mechanism to handle concurrent updates to the same document. When a document is updated, its version is incremented. If two parallel queries attempt to update the same document simultaneously, the following general sequence of events occurs:\n\nRead and Retrieve the Document:\n\nBoth queries read the document with its current version.\n\n\nUpdate Operation:\n\nBoth queries attempt to update the document simultaneously.\nElasticsearch uses the version number to determine the order of updates.\nOnly one of the updates is accepted based on the version number.\n\n\nVersion Conflict:\n\nIf the second update arrives with an outdated version number, Elasticsearch detects a version conflict.\nThe update with the outdated version is rejected, and the client needs to retry the update with the correct version.\n\n\n\nShard\n“shard” is the basic unit of data storage and distribution. It’s essentially a smaller, manageable piece of an index it contain lucene index.\nwhat is Lucence ?\nLucene.\nLucene is the base of ElasticSearch, but you don’t interract directly with him, as you drive your car, but you don’t ask direct to your engine to start. But what if your car break, don’t you think is a good idea to know how your engine works?\n\nLucene Indexing\n\nYou have a big a mount of files, and you need to find a specificy file, wich contais a certain word, how to be quickly to do this? how to be scalable? Here’s where indexing comes in: to search large amounts of text quickly, you must first index that text and convert it into a format that will let you search it rapidly. This conversion process is called indexing, and its output is called an index.\n\nLucene Index.\n\nThe index is composed of one or more segments, and each segment is composed of several indexes, confusing, right? When it is created, it is separated into smaller segments, or you can see it as sub-indices, where each index is not completely independent.\n\nLucene Segments.\n\nSegments are immutable .Each segment contains one or more Lucene Documents\nAt some point, on your journey through ES, you have been in the situation of having to delete a document. And apparently that was no problem, but what is going on behind the scenes?\nWhen you delete a document, it is only “marked” as deleted and a new version of the document is added to the segment. Its real execution is only carried out from time to time when a “joining” of larger segments occurs.\nIn the meantime, documents continue to take up disk space.\n\nLucene Merge.\n\nOver time the index will accumulate many segments. Periodically, segments are merged into a single new segment and removing the old segments.\nBut wait, whats it the benefits Merge my segments?\nBasically, because two important things, discard old documents and as result reduce our index space on disk, and the second one is the old segments are remove, and a new bigger segment are create, incresing your search speed.\nFrom elastic search &lt; 7.0 we have default 5 shard will be created now 1\nThe core structure of a Lucene index is the inverted index. It’s like a dictionary where terms (words or tokens) are mapped to the documents that contain them. In your example, the terms come from the “title” and “content” fields. “Document 1 Title”  “This is the content of Document 1.will be indexed as\n&quot;This&quot; -&gt; [doc2]\n&quot;Title&quot; -&gt; [doc1]\n&quot;is&quot; -&gt; [doc2]\n&quot;the&quot; -&gt; [doc2]\n&quot;content&quot; -&gt; [doc2]\n&quot;of&quot; -&gt; [doc2]\n&quot;Document&quot; -&gt; [doc1,doc2]\n&quot;1&quot; -&gt; [doc1,doc2]\n\nThere are 2 shard primary and replica shards both are fixed at index creation. replica of primary shard won’t store on the same node where primary exists\nTo find no of shards\nGET /your_index_name/_settings\nGET _/_cat/_shard/?v \n\nSegments\nElastic search buffers the documents for some time, and then creates one inverted index for all those documents. This “inverted index” is called Segment and this “sometimes” is called Refresh Time. This refreshing time is usually 1 second. Since every document takes the minimum of refresh time to get indexed, that’s why Elastic Search is called near-real-time analytics. The above optimization might save us some cost, but again, will it be scalable?\nNodes\nNode is a single instance of the Elasticsearch server. Nodes are responsible for various tasks such as data storage,      indexing, searching, and responding to client requests. There are two main types of nodes in Elasticsearch:\n\n\nData Node: A data node stores data and performs tasks related to data indexing and searching. It holds a portion of the index data and is responsible for the distributed storage and retrieval of documents.\n\n\nMaster Node: A master node is responsible for cluster coordination and management tasks. It maintains the cluster state, controls index creation and deletion, and manages the allocation of shards (the smallest unit of data storage in Elasticsearch) across data nodes.\n\n\ncoordination Node → distribute the query for the data node (The API sends a search or a get query to any of these nodes. The node it sends the query to becomes the “coordinator” node.)\n\n\nIngest Node → The Ingest Node Pipeline is a sequence of predefined or custom processors that operate on the incoming documents. These processors allow you to manipulate, enrich, or modify the data before it is indexed. Common tasks performed by processors include: After the data has been processed by the Ingest Node Pipeline, the transformed documents are indexed in Elasticsearch. The indexing process includes storing the documents in a suitable format and creating inverted indexes for efficient searching.\n\nGrok Processor: Parsing unstructured log data into structured fields.\nDate Processor: Parsing and formatting date fields.\nRemove Processor: Removing unwanted fields from documents.\nSet Processor: Setting values for specific fields.\nGeoIP Processor: Adding geo-location information based on IP addresses.\n\n\n\nTo define node type we need to give in elasticsearc.yml file when startingnode\nCluster:\nIn Elasticsearch, one or more nodes can form a cluster. A cluster is a group of interconnected Elasticsearch nodes that work together to store and manage data. It provides redundancy, fault tolerance, and the ability to distribute workloads across multiple nodes. create nodes with same cluster name in elasticsearch.yml on each node elastic search will take care to communicate with them using discovery.seed_hosts\n  cluster.name: your-cluster-name\n    node.name: Node1\n    network.host: 0.0.0.0\n    discovery.seed_hosts: [&quot;Node1_IP:9300&quot;, &quot;Node2_IP:9300&quot;, &quot;Node3_IP:9300&quot;]\n    cluster.initial_master_nodes: [&quot;Node1&quot;, &quot;Node2&quot;, &quot;Node3&quot;]\n\nMapping\nIt defines the structure of the database schema, including tables, columns, data types, constraints, and indexes. This ensures that your application’s data aligns with the database’s expectations.Proper mapping can optimize data retrieval and storage. For example, mapping may dictate the use of indexing or the choice of data types, which can impact query performance. GET /my-index-000001/_mapping → to see mapping of the index\nExplict → defining mapping on creating index with filed and types and we can add &quot;index&quot;: false to avoid indexing the document which we will not used for search which saves the memory\nData types\n\nText Data Types:\n\nText: Use the text data type for full-text search fields. This data type tokenizes text into terms, making it suitable for free-text search queries. It’s commonly used for fields like article content, product descriptions, and user comments.\nKeyword: Use the keyword data type for exact matching or sorting fields. Keywords are not tokenized and are typically used for fields like tags, categories, or IDs. They are excellent for filtering and aggregating.\n\n\nNumeric Data Types:\n\nInteger: Use the integer data type for whole numbers. It’s suitable for fields like age, price, and quantity when you need to perform mathematical operations or range queries.\nLong: Use the long data type for large integer values. It’s suitable for fields like timestamps, unique IDs, and counters.\nFloat/Double: Use the float or double data types for decimal numbers. Use float for less precision and storage, and double for higher precision. These are appropriate for fields like product prices, scores, and coordinates.\n\n\nDate Data Type:\n\nDate: Use the date data type for fields representing dates or timestamps. Elasticsearch can parse and store dates in a specific format, making it efficient for date range queries, date-based aggregations, and date math operations.\n\n\nBoolean Data Type:\n\nBoolean: Use the boolean data type for fields with true/false values, such as flags or checkboxes.\n\n\nGeo Data Types:\n\nGeo-point: Use the geo_point data type for storing latitude and longitude coordinates. It’s essential for location-based searches, such as finding nearby stores or places.\n\n\nBinary Data Type:\n\nBinary: Use the binary data type for fields containing binary data, such as images, documents, or multimedia files. Elasticsearch can store and retrieve binary data, but it doesn’t index the content for full-text searches.\n\n\nIP Data Type:\n\nIP: Use the ip data type for fields containing IP addresses. It allows efficient searching for IP ranges and aggregations based on IP addresses.\n\n\nOther Data Types:\n\nNested: Use the nested data type to work with arrays of objects or complex data structures where individual elements need to be indexed and searched independently.\nObject: Use the object data type for JSON-like objects that don’t require structured searching within the object fields.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right data type depends on your specific use case and how you intend to query and aggregate the data. Consider the following factors:\n\nSearch Requirements: Determine whether you need full-text search, exact matching, filtering, sorting, or aggregations for a particular field.\nData Volume: Consider the volume of data and the potential impact on storage and indexing performance, especially for large fields.\nAnalyzers: Choose appropriate analyzers and tokenization for text fields to ensure effective full-text searching.\nSorting and Aggregations: Use keyword fields for fields you need to sort or aggregate on.\nNumeric Precision: Choose the appropriate numeric data type (e.g., float vs. double) based on precision requirements.\n\nDynamic option in mapping\nif you set false then If there’s a mismatch (e.g., a field is of the wrong data type or has a different analyzer), Elasticsearch will reject the document.\nDynamic option in mapping\nif you set runtime then New fields are added to the mapping as runtime fields. These fields are not indexed, and are loaded from _source at query time.\nBecause runtime fields aren’t indexed, adding a runtime field doesn’t increase the index size. You define runtime fields directly in the index mapping, saving storage costs and increasing ingestion speed. You can more quickly ingest data into the Elastic Stack and access it right away. When you define a runtime field, you can immediately use it in search requests, aggregations, filtering, and sorting.\nThe “freshness_score” field is defined as a double data type and is a runtime field. It calculates the freshness score on-the-fly using a script that considers the timestamp of the review.\n\nMapping parameters\n\ntype:\n\nDescription: Specifies the data type of the field. Common types include text, keyword, integer, date, and more.\nExample: &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;\n\n\nanalyzer:\n\nDescription: Specifies the text analysis process (analyzer) to use for tokenization and text processing. Applicable to text fields.\nExample: &quot;analyzer&quot;: &quot;standard&quot;\n\n\nindex:\n\nDescription: Controls whether and how a field is indexed. Options include &quot;true&quot; (default), &quot;false&quot; (not indexed), and &quot;false&quot; with &quot;doc_values&quot; (indexed for sorting and aggregations, but not full-text search).\nExample: &quot;index&quot;: &quot;true&quot;\n\n\nnorms:\n\n\nDescription: Determines whether field length normalization is enabled. Norms are used for scoring and relevance calculations. if we set false for the filed that we not going to use for search to save space\n\n\nExample: &quot;norms&quot;: false\n\n\n\n\nRelevance calculations.\nRelevance calculation, often referred to as scoring or relevance scoring, is a fundamental concept in information retrieval and search engines, including Elasticsearch. It refers to the process of determining how well a document matches a user’s query based on various factors and assigning a numerical score to each document. This score reflects the document’s relevance to the query, allowing search engines to rank and return the most relevant documents to users.\nIn Elasticsearch, relevance calculations are primarily driven by the following key components:\n\nTerm Frequency (TF): This measures how often a term appears in a document. Documents that contain the query terms multiple times are considered more relevant.\nInverse Document Frequency (IDF): IDF assesses the importance of a term within a corpus of documents. Terms that appear in many documents are considered less important, while terms that appear in a smaller number of documents are considered more important.\nField Length Normalization: Longer documents tend to have more terms than shorter ones. Field length normalization adjusts the relevance score to account for the document’s length, ensuring that longer documents are not unfairly favored.\n. Coordination Factor: This factor accounts for how many of the query terms are present in a document. Documents that contain more query terms are typically more relevant.\nTerm Boosting: Elasticsearch allows you to assign different levels of importance (boosts) to individual query terms or fields, which can influence the relevance score.\n. BM25 Algorithm: Elasticsearch uses the BM25 ranking algorithm, which is a variation of TF-IDF with term frequency saturation and term weighting. BM25 is designed to be effective for full-text search and is the default scoring algorithm in Elasticsearch.\nScripting: Custom scripts can be used to calculate relevance scores based on complex criteria, such as business rules, personalization, or dynamic factors. This is particularly useful when standard scoring mechanisms are insufficient.\n\nMetadata fields of the documents\nEach document has metadata associated with it, such as the _index [The index to which the document belongs.] and _id metadata fields. The behavior of some of these metadata fields can be customized when a mapping is created.\n_Source →The original JSON representing the body of the document. when passing on creating of doc\n_field_names field used to index the names of every field in a document that contains any value other than null.\n_routing →A document is routed to a particular shard in an index using the following formulas: The default _routing value is the document’s [_id](&lt;www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-id-field.html&gt;)\nWhen you index a document into an Elasticsearch index, the document is first routed to a primary shard. The calculation for routing a document is performed as follows:\nElasticsearch calculates a hash of the routing value (in your example, the “product_id”). This hash value is typically a number.\nThe hash value is then divided by the total number of primary shards (the shard count you configured when creating the index). The result of this division determines which primary shard the document should be routed to.\nwe can user routing key on search to search on only specfic shard\nGET my-index-000001/_search\n        {\n          &quot;query&quot;: {\n            &quot;terms&quot;: {\n              &quot;_routing&quot;: [ &quot;key&quot; ] \n            }\n          }\n        }\n\nFor example, if you have an index with 5 primary shards and the hash value of your routing field is 123, Elasticsearch might route the document to the primary shard with an ID of 123 % 5 = 3.\nrouting_factor = num_routing_shards / num_primary_shards shard_num = (hash(_routing) % num_routing_shards) / routing_factor\nMapping types\nCertainly, let’s walk through an example to help you understand mapping types in Elasticsearch before they were deprecated in version 7.0. In this example, we’ll use an index for storing information about books, and we’ll define multiple mapping types within that index.\nHowever, it’s essential to note that, as of Elasticsearch 7.0, the above approach is no longer supported. In recent versions, you’d define your data structures within a single mapping type within an index. Mapping types have been deprecated in favor of a simpler data model.\nDynamic →allows you to experiment with and explore data when you’re just getting started. Elasticsearch adds new fields automatically, just by indexing a document. it add mapping by the first document you inserted\nType coresion → on first document if we passed age as float then we pass string it will be converted to float but if we send that can’t be converted it will throw error\nAnalyzer\nIt is responsible for breaking down, or tokenizing, a text into individual terms or tokens, applying various transformations to these tokens, and preparing them for efficient storage and retrieval. Analyzers are essential for full-text search engines like Elasticsearch and Lucene, and they greatly influence the accuracy and relevance of search results.\nHere are the key components and functions of an analyzer:\n\nTokenization: The analyzer tokenizes the input text, which means it splits the text into individual words, phrases, or terms. For example, the sentence “The quick brown fox” might be tokenized into individual terms like “The,” “quick,” “brown,” and “fox.”\nLowercasing: In many analyzers, text is converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive searching. This means that “Quick” and “quick” would be treated as the same term.\nFiltering: Analyzers often apply filters to remove or modify tokens. Common filters include:\n\nStopword Removal: Removing common words (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the”) that do not carry significant meaning.\nStemming: Reducing words to their root or base form (e.g., “running” becomes “run”).\nSynonym Expansion: Expanding tokens to include synonyms (e.g., “car” and “automobile”).\nCharacter Filtering: Removing or replacing specific characters (e.g., punctuation marks).\n\n\nToken Type Assignments: Analyzers may assign token types or attributes to each token. This information can be used for advanced searching and filtering.\nNormalization: Some analyzers perform normalization, ensuring that different forms of a word (e.g., singular and plural) are treated as equivalent.\nCustomization: Analyzers can be customized to suit specific requirements. In Elasticsearch, you can define your own custom analyzers, combining various tokenizers and filters.\n\n    POST /_analyze {text:&quot;hai&quot;,analyzer:standard}\n\nADMIN\nTo get full detail about elastic search GET _cluster/state will return\n{\n        &quot;cluster_name&quot; : &quot;elasticsearch&quot;,\n        &quot;cluster_uuid&quot; : &quot;HazzKHDGSA2hmmsKGVDCeA&quot;,\n        &quot;version&quot; : 33584,\n        &quot;state_uuid&quot; : &quot;LEl8OGf2S9iVh73NovnQVQ&quot;,\n        &quot;master_node&quot; : &quot;TtayhcCMTmqa020lB-3k4A&quot;,\n        &quot;blocks&quot; : { },\n        &quot;nodes&quot; : {  \n            &quot;cp1SAtq2SIKWjJwfm2pqGg&quot; : {\n              &quot;name&quot; : &quot;elasticsearch-data&quot;,\n              &quot;ephemeral_id&quot; : &quot;jhqJvC_PS2a0KvoZV6zSWg&quot;,\n              &quot;transport_address&quot; : &quot;10.244.2.25:9300&quot;,\n              &quot;attributes&quot; : {\n                &quot;ml.machine_memory&quot; : &quot;6442450944&quot;,\n                &quot;ml.max_open_jobs&quot; : &quot;512&quot;,\n                &quot;xpack.installed&quot; : &quot;true&quot;,\n                &quot;ml.max_jvm_size&quot; : &quot;4294967296&quot;,\n                &quot;transform.node&quot; : &quot;true&quot;\n              },\n              &quot;roles&quot; : [\n                &quot;data&quot;,\n                &quot;data_cold&quot;,\n                &quot;data_content&quot;,\n                &quot;data_frozen&quot;,\n                &quot;data_hot&quot;,\n                &quot;data_warm&quot;,\n                &quot;ml&quot;,\n                &quot;remote_cluster_client&quot;,\n                &quot;transform&quot;\n              ]\n            },\n            &quot;hXF1BAkKT6eaFlcqqE5_6Q&quot; : {\n              &quot;name&quot; : &quot;elasticsearch-client&quot;,\n              &quot;ephemeral_id&quot; : &quot;tQpQ2OldR3G6k6IL1B5a7w&quot;,\n              &quot;transport_address&quot; : &quot;10.244.2.20:9300&quot;,\n              &quot;attributes&quot; : {\n                &quot;ml.machine_memory&quot; : &quot;4294967296&quot;,\n                &quot;ml.max_open_jobs&quot; : &quot;512&quot;,\n                &quot;xpack.installed&quot; : &quot;true&quot;,\n                &quot;ml.max_jvm_size&quot; : &quot;3221225472&quot;,\n                &quot;transform.node&quot; : &quot;false&quot;\n              },\n              &quot;roles&quot; : [\n                &quot;ingest&quot;,\n                &quot;ml&quot;,\n                &quot;remote_cluster_client&quot;\n              ]\n            },\n            &quot;TtayhcCMTmqa020lB-3k4A&quot; : {\n              &quot;name&quot; : &quot;elasticsearch-master&quot;,\n              &quot;ephemeral_id&quot; : &quot;LDfJRzqtQ8m9VsdD07XGdA&quot;,\n              &quot;transport_address&quot; : &quot;10.244.2.23:9300&quot;,\n              &quot;attributes&quot; : {\n                &quot;ml.machine_memory&quot; : &quot;4294967296&quot;,\n                &quot;ml.max_open_jobs&quot; : &quot;512&quot;,\n                &quot;xpack.installed&quot; : &quot;true&quot;,\n                &quot;ml.max_jvm_size&quot; : &quot;3221225472&quot;,\n                &quot;transform.node&quot; : &quot;false&quot;\n              },\n              &quot;roles&quot; : [\n                &quot;master&quot;,\n                &quot;ml&quot;,\n                &quot;remote_cluster_client&quot;\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n        metadata:{}\n        }\n\nnodes → all nodes with details\nmetadata → contain all indices and template and all details\n\nlogstash\nilm_rollover_alias\nCertainly! Let’s illustrate the concept of ilm_rollover_alias using an example scenario:\n elasticsearch {\n        hosts =&gt; &quot;&lt;https://localhost:9243&gt;&quot;\n        user =&gt; &quot;elastic&quot;\n        password =&gt; &quot;1234567&quot;\n        ilm_rollover_alias =&gt; &#039;klenty-consumers&#039;\n        ilm_pattern =&gt; &quot;{now/d}-00001&quot;\n        template =&gt; &#039;/etc/logstash/templates/index_template.json&#039;\n        ilm_policy =&gt; &quot;klenty-rollover-1-day&quot;\n        ilm_enabled =&gt; true\n    }\n    \n\nScenario: Imagine you have a system that generates log data, and you want to store this data in Elasticsearch. To efficiently manage the data and make it easier to query, you decide to use Elasticsearch’s Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) feature and Logstash to send the data to Elasticsearch.\nLogstash Configuration:\nHere’s your Logstash configuration with the ilm_rollover_alias setting:\nExplanation with an Example:\n\nInitialization:\n\nYou start Logstash, and it begins sending log data to Elasticsearch.\nLogstash creates an initial Elasticsearch index with a name based on the ilm_pattern and the current date. For example, if the current date is September 17, 2023, it might create an index named “2023.09.17-00001.”\nThe alias ‘klenty-consumers’ is associated with this initial index because of the ilm_rollover_alias setting.\n\n\nData Ingestion:\n\nLogstash continues to send log data to the active index, which is “2023.09.17-00001” in this example.\nElasticsearch stores the data in this index.\n\n\nRollover Trigger:\n\nYour ILM policy, “klenty-rollover-1-day,” is configured to perform a rollover based on a time condition, such as daily.\nWhen the new day begins (e.g., on September 18, 2023), the ILM policy triggers a rollover operation.\n\n\nRollover Operation:\n\nThe ILM policy orchestrates the rollover. It closes the current active index, which is “2023.09.17-00001,” and creates a new index for the new day, let’s say “2023.09.18-00001.”\n\n\nAlias Update:\n\nAfter the rollover operation, the alias ‘klenty-consumers’ is automatically updated by Elasticsearch to point to the newly created index, which is now “2023.09.18-00001.”\n\n\nContinued Data Ingestion:\n\nLogstash continues to send log data, and Elasticsearch stores it in the newly active index, “2023.09.18-00001.”\n\n\nQuerying Data:\n\nApplications can consistently query data using the ‘klenty-consumers’ alias. They don’t need to be aware of the specific index names because the alias always points to the active index.\n\n\nLifecycle Management:\n\nThe process repeats daily as per the ILM policy, creating new indices for each day, automatically updating the alias, and ensuring that data is efficiently organized and managed.\n\n\n\nIn summary, ilm_rollover_alias allows you to create a consistent entry point (‘klenty-consumers’ alias) for your data, making it easy to query and manage, even as Elasticsearch automatically rolls over to new indices based on your defined criteria, such as time or size. This ensures efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data while abstracting the complexity of index management.\n\n\niim_rollover_alias → used when we want to send data with same index name to handle rollover\nCertainly, let’s break down the concept of aliases in Elasticsearch and how they are used in conjunction with index rollovers with a practical example.\nAlias in Elasticsearch: An alias is like a virtual pointer or nickname that you give to one or more indices. Instead of referring to a specific index directly, your applications, including Logstash, interact with the alias. This provides a level of abstraction that allows you to change which index the alias points to without needing to modify your application code.\nIndex Rollover with Aliases: When working with time-series data, like logs, you often want to create new indices at regular intervals (e.g., daily or monthly) to efficiently manage and store your data. Index rollover is a technique used to automate this process.\nHere’s a step-by-step explanation with an example:\nStep 1: Set Up Initial Index and Alias:\n\nYou create an initial index, let’s call it logs-2023-09-26, where the date is part of the index name.\nYou also create an alias, say logs-alias, and initially, you point it to the initial index logs-2023-09-26. Logstash is configured to send data to logs-alias.\n\nStep 2: Index Rollover Conditions:\nYou define conditions in Elasticsearch, typically using an ILM policy, for when a rollover should occur. These conditions might include criteria like the index reaching a certain size, age, or number of documents.\nStep 3: Elasticsearch Monitoring:\nElasticsearch constantly monitors the index associated with the alias, which, in this case, is logs-2023-09-26. It checks whether the rollover conditions defined in the ILM policy are met.\nStep 4: Rollover Triggered:\nLet’s say your ILM policy specifies that a rollover should occur when an index reaches a size of 5GB. When the data ingested into logs-2023-09-26 exceeds 5GB, Elasticsearch triggers the rollover automatically, without any direct action from Logstash.\nStep 5: New Index Created:\nElasticsearch creates a new index, such as logs-2023-09-27, based on the template and settings you’ve defined. This new index is empty and ready to receive data.\nStep 6: Alias Update:\nElasticsearch updates the alias logs-alias to point to the new index, logs-2023-09-27. Now, any new data sent by Logstash is directed to the newly created index without Logstash needing to be aware of this change. Logstash continues to send data to logs-alias.\nStep 7: Repeat:\nThe process repeats as data continues to be ingested. When the rollover conditions are met again, another new index is created, and the alias is updated. This cycle continues, and Logstash sends data to the alias without interruption.\nExample: Let’s assume you have an ILM policy with a rollover condition of reaching 5GB in index size. When logs-2023-09-26 reaches 5GB, Elasticsearch creates logs-2023-09-27 and updates logs-alias to point to it. Logstash, which has been sending data to logs-alias, seamlessly starts sending data to the new index.\nThis process ensures that your data is efficiently managed, and you can query it across multiple indices using the same alias (logs-alias), regardless of how many indices have been created through rollovers. It abstracts the complexity of index management from your applications, making it easier to scale and maintain your Elasticsearch setup.\n\n\nAlias vs index patterns\nYou’re correct that both aliases and index patterns can be used to facilitate querying in Elasticsearch. However, they serve slightly different purposes, and their use cases can overlap. Let’s explore the differences between aliases and index patterns:\n1. Aliases:\n\nPurpose: Aliases are primarily used to abstract the physical index names and provide a consistent, user-friendly name for querying. They act as pointers to one or more indices.\nUse Case: Aliases are useful when you want to ensure that your application or users always interact with a specific index or a group of indices, regardless of the underlying index names. They are often used for managing data lifecycle, providing a stable entry point for querying, and for tasks like index swapping during rollovers.\nDynamic: Aliases can be updated dynamically by Elasticsearch to point to different indices based on conditions, such as rollover events or data aging.\nAliases only accessed through code\n\n2. Index Patterns:\n\nPurpose: Index patterns are used to define patterns for matching multiple indices based on their names. They are typically used for querying or applying actions across multiple indices that match a specific naming pattern.\nUse Case: Index patterns are useful when you want to perform actions or queries across a set of indices that share a common naming convention. For example, you might use an index pattern like “logstash-*” to match all indices with names starting with “logstash-” regardless of the date or version in the index name.\nStatic: Index patterns are defined in advance and are not updated dynamically like aliases. They rely on consistent naming conventions.\nAcessed through discover page in kibana\n\nKey Differences:\n\nDynamic vs. Static: Aliases can be updated dynamically by Elasticsearch, making them suitable for scenarios where the active index changes due to rollovers or other events. Index patterns are defined statically and do not change automatically.\nStability vs. Flexibility: Aliases provide stability by always pointing to a specific index or the most recent index in a sequence. Index patterns offer flexibility for querying across multiple indices with similar names.\nUse Cases: Aliases are commonly used for index lifecycle management, ensuring consistent querying, and providing a stable entry point. Index patterns are more suitable for querying and performing actions across sets of indices with similar names.\n\nUse Both When Needed:\nIn practice, you can use both aliases and index patterns in combination to achieve different objectives. For instance, you can use an alias like ‘klenty-consumers’ for stable querying and use an index pattern like ‘logstash-*’ for broader operational tasks across multiple log indices.\nIn summary, aliases and index patterns are complementary tools in Elasticsearch, and their effectiveness depends on the specific requirements of your use case. Aliases provide stability and dynamic management, while index patterns are helpful for querying and performing actions across groups of indices with similar names.\n\n\nNeed to check how\n elasticsearch {\n      hosts =&gt; &quot;&lt;klenty-kibana-pipeline.es.us-east4.gcp.elastic-cloud.com:9243&gt;&quot;\n    user =&gt; &quot;elastic&quot;\n    password =&gt; &quot;zQb0V7ZssNF7oygnLfz5SetO&quot;\n      ilm_rollover_alias =&gt; &#039;klenty-email-validation-logs&#039;\n      ilm_pattern =&gt; &quot;{now/d}-00001&quot;\n      template =&gt; &#039;/etc/logstash/templates/index_template.json&#039;\n      ilm_policy =&gt; &quot;klenty-rollover-1-day&quot;\n      ilm_enabled =&gt; true\n    }\nthis make created as klenty-email-validation-logs-data-0001\n\n\nWhy\nThe Logstash configuration you provided is used to create an Elasticsearch index with specific settings and configurations. Let’s break down the configuration and explain how the index will be created on a daily basis with examples and in-depth details.\n\n\nElasticsearch Output Configuration:\nelasticsearch {\n  hosts =&gt; &quot;&lt;https://localhost:9243&gt;&quot;\n  user =&gt; &quot;elastic&quot;\n  password =&gt; &quot;123456789&quot;\n  ilm_rollover_alias =&gt; &#039;klenty-email-validation-logs&#039;\n  ilm_pattern =&gt; &quot;{now/d}-00001&quot;\n  template =&gt; &#039;/etc/logstash/templates/index_template.json&#039;\n  ilm_policy =&gt; &quot;klenty-rollover-1-day&quot;\n  ilm_enabled =&gt; true\n}\n \n\nhosts: This specifies the Elasticsearch cluster’s address where Logstash will send data. In your case, it’s “https://localhost:9243,” assuming Elasticsearch is running on localhost on port 9243.\nuser and password: These are the credentials used for authentication when sending data to Elasticsearch.\nilm_rollover_alias: This is the alias that will be associated with the index. It’s set to ‘klenty-email-validation-logs.’\nilm_pattern: This pattern is used to generate the index name. {now/d} represents the current date in the format ‘YYYY.MM.dd,’ and ‘-00001’ is added to create a unique index name. This will result in an index name like ‘klenty-email-validation-logs-2023.09.17-00001’ for today’s date (assuming today is September 17, 2023).\ntemplate: Specifies the path to an index template. The template contains predefined settings and mappings for the index. You provided a JSON template located at ‘/etc/logstash/templates/index_template.json.’\nilm_policy: This is the name of the Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policy associated with the index. In your case, it’s “klenty-rollover-1-day.” ILM policies define how indices are managed, including when they should be rolled over and deleted.\nilm_enabled: This flag is set to true, indicating that ILM is enabled for this index.\nDOCS\n\nwww.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex Template (From ‘/etc/logstash/templates/index_template.json’):\nThe index template provided in your configuration contains various settings for the index. Let’s break down some key settings:\n\nlifecycle: Specifies the ILM settings for the index, including the ILM policy name (“klenty-rollover-1-day”) and the rollover alias (“klenty-email-validation-logs”).\nrouting: Defines how documents are allocated across nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster. In your configuration, it includes _tier_preference: &quot;data_content&quot; for routing.\nmapping: Sets the total fields limit to 10,000 for this index. This limit restricts the number of fields that can be indexed in a single document.\nrefresh_interval: Specifies that the index will be refreshed every 5 seconds. This controls how often changes become visible to search.\n\n\n\nIndex Creation on a Daily Basis:\nWith this configuration, an index will be created in Elasticsearch daily. Here’s how it works with an example:\n\nToday is September 17, 2023.\nLogstash processes and sends data to Elasticsearch.\nElasticsearch uses the ILM pattern “{now/d}-00001” to create the index name: “klenty-email-validation-logs-2023.09.17-00001.”\nThe index inherits settings and mappings from the provided template ‘/etc/logstash/templates/index_template.json.’\nThe ILM policy “klenty-rollover-1-day” is associated with the index, which defines when the index should roll over (in this case, likely after one day) and how data retention is managed.\n\nThe next day (September 18, 2023), a new index will be created with the name “klenty-email-validation-logs-2023.09.18-00001,” and this process repeats daily.\n\n\nThis setup ensures that your Elasticsearch indices are created with the specified settings, follow a daily naming pattern, and are managed according to the ILM policy you’ve defined, allowing for efficient data retention and maintenance.\n\n\nQuery\n\n\nElasticsearch sorts matching search results by relevance score,\n\n\nThe relevance score is a positive floating point number, returned in the _score metadata field of the search API. The higher the _score, the more relevant the document. While each query type can calculate relevance scores differently, score calculation also depends on whether the query clause is run in a query or filter context.\n\n\nQuery context → answers the question “How well does this document match this query clause?” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score metadata field.\n\nQuery context is in effect whenever a query clause is passed to a query parameter\n\n\n\nFilter context →answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated\n\nFrequently used filters will be cached automatically by Elasticsearch, to speed up performance\nFilter context is in effect whenever a query clause is passed to a filter parameter\n\n\n\nRelevance Score\nThe relevance score, also known as the “_score” in Elasticsearch, represents how well a document matches a given query. It’s a numerical value assigned to each document returned by a search, indicating the degree of relevance to the search criteria. The higher the score, the more relevant the document is considered.\nHow Relevance Score is Calculated:\n\nElasticsearch uses a scoring algorithm, typically the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm or its variations, to calculate the relevance score.\nThe score takes into account factors such as the frequency of query terms in the document, the length of the document, and the overall frequency of terms in the entire index.\n\nExample: Let’s consider a simple example. Assume you have an index of articles and you perform a search for the query “machine learning.”\n\nDocument 1: “Introduction to Machine Learning”\n\nContains the exact phrase “machine learning” multiple times.\nMedium-length document.\n\n\nDocument 2: “The History of Artificial Intelligence”\n\nMentions “machine learning” once.\nLong document.\n\n\nDocument 3: “Cooking Recipes for Beginners”\n\nDoesn’t contain the phrase “machine learning.”\nShort document.\n\n\n\nIn this scenario, Elasticsearch would calculate a relevance score for each document based on factors like term frequency and document length. Let’s say the scores are as follows:\n\nDocument 1: Relevance Score = 8.2\nDocument 2: Relevance Score = 4.5\nDocument 3: Relevance Score = 1.1\n\nWhen presenting the search results, Elasticsearch would order them by relevance score in descending order, so Document 1 would be listed first, followed by Document 2, and then Document 3.\nThis scoring mechanism allows Elasticsearch to provide more relevant search results to users by considering not only the presence of query terms but also their frequency and importance in the documents.\n\n\n\n\nExample [basic cannot use complex]\nGET _search\n{\n  &quot;query&quot;: {\n    &quot;match&quot;: {\n      &quot;FIELD&quot;: &quot;TEXT&quot;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nExample with aggregation\nGET /_search\n{\n  &quot;query&quot;: {\n    &quot;bool&quot;: {\n      &quot;must&quot;: [\n        {\n          &quot;match&quot;: {\n            &quot;title&quot;: &quot;smith&quot;\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      &quot;must_not&quot;: [\n        {\n          &quot;match_phrase&quot;: {\n            &quot;title&quot;: &quot;granny smith&quot;\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      &quot;filter&quot;: [\n        {\n          &quot;exists&quot;: {\n            &quot;field&quot;: &quot;title&quot;\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  &quot;aggs&quot;: {\n    &quot;my_agg&quot;: {\n      &quot;terms&quot;: {\n        &quot;field&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,\n        &quot;size&quot;: 10\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  &quot;highlight&quot;: {\n    &quot;pre_tags&quot;: [\n      &quot;&lt;em&gt;&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;post_tags&quot;: [\n      &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;fields&quot;: {\n      &quot;body&quot;: {\n        &quot;number_of_fragments&quot;: 1,\n        &quot;fragment_size&quot;: 20\n      },\n      &quot;title&quot;: {}\n    }\n  },\n  &quot;size&quot;: 20,\n  &quot;from&quot;: 100,\n  &quot;_source&quot;: [\n    &quot;title&quot;,\n    &quot;id&quot;\n  ],\n  &quot;sort&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;_id&quot;: {\n        &quot;order&quot;: &quot;desc&quot;\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nQuery Result with explanation\n\n\nOutput\n{\n  &quot;took&quot; : 5,\n  &quot;timed_out&quot; : false,\n  &quot;_shards&quot; : {\n    &quot;total&quot; : 1,\n    &quot;successful&quot; : 1,\n    &quot;skipped&quot; : 0,\n    &quot;failed&quot; : 0\n  },\n  &quot;hits&quot; : {\n    &quot;total&quot; : {\n      &quot;value&quot; : 2,\n      &quot;relation&quot; : &quot;eq&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;max_score&quot; : 29.626675,\n    &quot;hits&quot; : [\n      {\n        &quot;_index&quot; : &quot;news&quot;,\n        &quot;_id&quot; : &quot;RzrouIsBC1dvdsZHf2cP&quot;,\n        &quot;_score&quot; : 29.626675,\n        &quot;_source&quot; : {\n          &quot;link&quot; : &quot;&lt;www.huffpost.com/entry/guard-cat-hailed-as-hero_n_62e9a515e4b00f4cf2352a6f&gt;&quot;,\n          &quot;headline&quot; : &quot;Bandit The &#039;Guard Cat&#039; Hailed As Hero After Thwarting Would-Be Robbery&quot;,\n          &quot;short_description&quot; : &quot;When at least two people tried to break into a Tupelo, Mississippi, home last week, the cat did everything she could to alert its owner.&quot;,\n          &quot;category&quot; : &quot;WEIRD NEWS&quot;,\n          &quot;authors&quot; : &quot;&quot;,\n          &quot;country&quot; : &quot;US&quot;,\n          &quot;timestamp&quot; : 1693070640\n        }\n      },\n      .....\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe _shards field tells how many shards were involved in this search operation, how many of them returned successfully, how many failed, and how many skipped.\n\n\nThe hits field contains the documents returned from the search.

This queue size is per thread in the threadpool.\n\n\nCalculating Request Impact on Threadpool:\n\nThe number of requests that can be handled simultaneously depends on the number of processors (cores) and shards hit by each search.\nFor instance, if a search runs on 3 indices, each having 2 shards, there would be 6 requests in the threadpool per search.\nExample: Let’s say you have two servers, each with 8 cores.

It offers a unified experience for building, training, deploying, managing, and scaling machine learning workloads.\nVertex AI provides a wide range of tools to support the entire machine learning workflow, from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring.\nThe platform caters to users with varying levels of machine learning expertise, from beginners to seasoned professionals.\nVertex AI is built on Google’s secure and robust infrastructure, ensuring a seamless and flexible user experience.\n\nFour Broad Categories of Machine Learning Offerings\nGoogle Cloud offers four main categories of machine learning options, each catering to different needs and priorities:\n\nML APIs: These provide a quick and easy way to get started with machine learning, requiring minimal effort and no customization.\nVertex AI with AutoML: This option is suitable for users who need some customization and are willing to invest time and effort. AutoML supports four data types: text, tabular data, images, and videos.\nVertex AI with Custom Models: This option is designed for machine learning experts who require a highly customizable platform to build models for specific needs.\nBigQuery ML (BQML): BQML allows users to create descriptive or predictive machine learning models using simple SQL queries. It is suitable for working with large datasets, even petabyte-scale data stored in BigQuery.\n\nUnderstanding AutoML in Vertex AI\n\nAutoML simplifies the machine learning workflow by automating key steps. Users simply load their data, set training budgets, and AutoML handles the rest, including model selection, training, and prediction.\nAutoML eliminates the need to manually choose model architecture, build models, and tune parameters, saving time and effort. This makes it the fastest way to go from data to valuable insights.\nAutoML provides a user-friendly, codeless interface that guides users through the entire machine learning lifecycle. It also offers automation and guardrails at each step to ensure a smooth experience.\nAutoML leverages Google’s extensive model zoo to find the best model for the given data. This includes a wide range of models, from feedforward DNNs to deep and wide neural networks, gradient boosted decision trees, and various combinations.\n\nExploring Custom Modeling in Vertex AI\n\nCustom modeling in Vertex AI caters to complex and niche use cases that cannot be addressed by other machine learning options.\nUsers have complete control over their instance setup, from uploading training data to building and training their own models using virtual machines with custom configurations.\nVertex AI offers pre-built containers for PyTorch, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and XGBoost, and users can also bring their own custom containers.\nThe platform allows for model deployment and serving using Cloud Endpoints or Batch AI for batch predictions.\n\n."},"notes/2024/Grafana":{"title":"Grafana","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Prometheus Server: This component is responsible for scraping and storing time-series data.

An open port can indicate a potential entry point for communication with a system.\n\n\nClosed: A closed port means that there is no application listening on that port. The system actively responds with a TCP RST packet for TCP scans or with an ICMP port unreachable message for UDP scans, indicating that the port is closed and no connection is possible.\n\n\nFiltered: This state means that nmap was unable to determine whether the port is open or closed. This typically happens when a firewall or other network filtering device prevents nmap from making a reliable determination of the port’s state. nmap cannot reliably tell whether the port is open or closed, so it reports the port as filtered.\n\n\nUnfiltered: This state indicates that the port is accessible, but nmap cannot determine whether it is open or closed. It means that nmap was able to establish that the port is not firewalled, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether there is an active service listening on that port.\n\n\nOpen|Filtered: This state indicates that nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.

Use the following command, replacing “1.1.1.1” with the spoofed IP address, “9912” with your chosen port, and “receiver-server.com” with the receiving server’s address: nping --tcp -p 9912 -S 1.1.1.1 receiver-server.com\nCheck the receiving server’s logs: If you see a packet from the spoofed IP address (1.1.1.1 in the example command) in the receiving server’s logs, your hosting provider allows IP address spoofing.\n\nWhy This Matters: If a hosting provider allows IP address spoofing, attackers can launch denial-of-service attacks that trigger automatic abuse reports. These reports will appear to come from your server, even though you aren’t responsible for the malicious traffic.\nLet me know if you need more information about this type of attack or how to protect against it.\nEmail vulenrablity\nHTML Emails\n\n\nAttackers craft an HTML email with specific CSS rules that target the structural changes introduced when an email is forwarded.\n\n\nThese CSS rules dictate that certain elements, referred to as “kobold letters”, remain hidden in the original email but become visible only after forwarding.\n\n\nWhen the recipient forwards the email, the DOM structure changes, triggering the CSS rules and revealing the hidden content, such as a phishing request.\n\n\nThe original sender of the forwarded email remains unaware of the change in content.\nExamples in Different Email Clients:\n\n\nThunderbird: This email client wraps emails in a specific &lt;div&gt; tag, allowing attackers to exploit predictable DOM changes upon forwarding.\n\n\nOutlook on the web (OWA): While OWA modifies email content and CSS to prevent styling conflicts, attackers can still exploit predictable changes in the DOM structure after forwarding.\n\n\nGmail: Although Gmail strips styling when forwarding emails, attackers can still exploit this by hiding content in the original email, which becomes visible after forwarding due to the removal of CSS.\nSource here\n\n"},"notes/2024/Hands-On-Machine-Learningwith-Scikit-Learn,-Keras,-andTensorFlow":{"title":"Hands-On Machine Learningwith Scikit-Learn, Keras, andTensorFlow","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Fundamentals of Machine Learning\nTypes of Machine Learning\nSupervised learning\nTrained Data with label and predict the data example : classification,\n\nRegression algorithms\nk-Nearest Neighbors\nLinear Regression\nLogistic Regression\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs)\nDecision Trees and Random Forests\nNeural networks\n\nUnsupervised learning\nThe training data is unlabeled\nClustering\n\nK-Means\nDBSCAN\nHierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)\n\nAnomaly detection and novelty detection\n\nOne-class SVM\nIsolation Forest\n\nVisualization and dimensionality reduction\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nKernel PCA\nLocally Linear Embedding (LLE)\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n\nAssociation rule learning\n\nApriori\nEclat\n\nReinforcement Learning\nThe learning system, called an agent in this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards in return"},"notes/2024/Haystack-Notes":{"title":"Haystack Notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Haystack\nHaystack provides all the tools you need to build a custom RAG pipelines with LLMs that works for you.

Inference is run by Hugging Face in a dedicated, fully managed infrastructure on a cloud provider of your choice.\n\nhuggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-widgets\nPipelines\nIt connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer:\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n \nclassifier = pipeline(&quot;sentiment-analysis&quot;)\nclassifier(&quot;I&#039;ve been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.&quot;)\nSome of the currently available pipelines are:\n\nfeature-extraction (get the vector representation of a text)\nfill-mask\nner (named entity recognition)\nquestion-answering\nsentiment-analysis\nsummarization\ntext-generation\ntranslation\nzero-shot-classification\n\nUsing any model from the Hub in a pipeline\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n \ngenerator = pipeline(&quot;text-generation&quot;, model=&quot;distilgpt2&quot;)\ngenerator(\n    &quot;In this course, we will teach you how to&quot;,\n    max_length=30,\n    num_return_sequences=2,\n)\n\nCheckpoints: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.\n\nPipelines under the hood\nfirst step of our pipeline is to convert the text inputs into numbers that the model can make sense of. To do this we use a tokenizer, which will be responsible for:\n\nSplitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called tokens\nMapping each token to an integer\nAdding additional inputs that may be useful to the model\n\nAll this preprocessing needs to be done in exactly the same way as when the model was pretrained, so we first need to download that information from the Model Hub. To do this, we use the AutoTokenizer class and its from_pretrained() method. Using the checkpoint name of our model\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n \ncheckpoint = &quot;distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english&quot;\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\nNote: Transformer models only accept tensors as input.\nraw_inputs = [\n    &quot;I&#039;ve been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.&quot;,\n    &quot;I hate this so much!&quot;,\n]\ninputs = tokenizer(raw_inputs, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;)\nprint(inputs)\n \n{\n    &#039;input_ids&#039;: tensor([\n        [  101,  1045,  1005,  2310,  2042, ...],\n        [  101,  1045,  5223,  ....]\n    ]), \n    &#039;attention_mask&#039;: tensor([\n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n}\nThe output itself is a dictionary containing two keys, input_ids and attention_mask. input_ids\nwe can use  Transformers without having to worry about which ML framework is used as a backend; it might be PyTorch or TensorFlow, or Flax for some models. but transformer will take care of it.\nTo specify the type of tensors we want to get back (PyTorch, TensorFlow, or plain NumPy), we use the return_tensors argument:\nNext step pass the token to transformer\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\n \ncheckpoint = &quot;distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english&quot;\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\n \noutputs = model(**inputs)\n \nprint(outputs.logits.shape)\nA Transformer model processes text and produces a high-dimensional vector of hidden states, which represent the model’s contextual understanding of the input\nThese hidden states are usually fed into another part of the model called a head.\nThe head transforms these high-dimensional vectors into a format suitable for a specific task.\nExample:\nClassification Head\n\nPurpose: Used for tasks where the goal is to assign an input to one of several predefined categories (e.g., sentiment analysis, image classification).\nHow It Works:\n\nThe output from the transformer layers (hidden states) is fed into a linear layer, which projects the high-dimensional vectors down to the number of classes.\nA softmax function is then applied to convert these scores into probabilities for each class.\n\n\n\nSequence Generation Head\n\nPurpose: Used for tasks where the goal is to generate a sequence of outputs, such as text generation or machine translation.\nHow It Works:\n\nTypically, this involves a decoder structure that predicts the next token in the sequence based on the previous tokens and the context provided by the encoder.\nIt often uses techniques like beam search or greedy decoding to generate coherent sequences.\n\n\n\nDifferent head architectures are designed for specific tasks. Some examples are:\n\nForCausalLM\nForMaskedLM\nForMultipleChoice\nForQuestionAnswering\nForSequenceClassification\nForTokenClassification\n\nThe output of the head often requires further processing to make sense of it\nFor instance, the raw output of the model (logits) may need to be converted into probabilities using a SoftMax layer\nPostprocessing the output\nOutput will contain probablity to convert we need softmax layer(Transformers models output the logits, as the loss function for training will generally fuse the last activation function, such as SoftMax, with the actual loss function, such as cross entropy)\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\nimport torch\n \n# Define the model checkpoint\ncheckpoint = &quot;distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english&quot;\n \n# Load the tokenizer and model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\n \n# Input sentences\nraw_inputs = [\n    &quot;I&#039;ve been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.&quot;,\n    &quot;I hate this so much!&quot;,\n]\n \n# Tokenize the input sentences\ninputs = tokenizer(raw_inputs, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;)\n \n# Pass the inputs through the model\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n \n# Convert logits to probabilities\npredictions = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)\n \n# Print the predictions and labels\nprint(predictions)\nprint(model.config.id2label)\nModels\nThe AutoModel class in Hugging Face acts as a wrapper for different model architectures within the library. This class can intelligently determine the appropriate model architecture for a given checkpoint and instantiate a model with that architecture. For instance, if we load a BERT checkpoint, AutoModel will automatically instantiate a BERT model.\nfrom transformers import BertConfig, BertModel\n \n# Building the config\nconfig = BertConfig()\n \n# Building the model from the config\nmodel = BertModel(config)\nDirect Instantiation: If we know the specific model type you want to use, we can directly use the class corresponding to its architecture. For example, we can use BertModel directly to create a BERT model.\nModel Configuration: Models are built based on a configuration object, like BertConfig for BERT models. This configuration contains attributes that define the model’s architecture, such as the hidden state size (hidden_size) and the number of Transformer layers (num_hidden_layers).\nModel Initialization: Creating a model from the default configuration initializes it with random values. Such a model needs to be trained before it can be used effectively.\nLoading Pre-trained Models: Pre-trained models can be loaded using the from_pretrained() method. This method takes a model identifier (e.g., “bert-base-cased”) and downloads and caches the model weights. Using pre-trained models is crucial to save time, resources, and minimize environmental impact.\nfrom transformers import BertModel\n \nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained(&quot;bert-base-cased&quot;)\nCheckpoint Agnostic Code: The AutoModel class allows you to write checkpoint-agnostic code, which means your code can work with different checkpoints, even if the architecture is different, as long as the checkpoints are trained for similar tasks.\nSaving Models: The save_pretrained() method saves the model to your disk in two files: config.json and pytorch_model.bin.\n- config.json: This file contains the model’s architecture and metadata.\n- pytorch_model.bin: This file, known as the state dictionary, contains the model’s weights.\nModel Inference: Once loaded, models can be used for inference. This involves tokenizing the input text and converting it into tensors that the model can understand.\n- The model() function is then called with these tensors to generate predictions.\n- For specific tasks like sentiment analysis, we might use specialized models like AutoModelForSequenceClassification.\n- The output of a model often requires further processing, such as converting logits into probabilities using a SoftMax layer, before interpretation.\nfrom transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\n \n# Model identifier\nmodel_id = &quot;bert-base-cased&quot;\n \n# Loading the configuration, tokenizer, and model\nconfig = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_id)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_id)\n \n# Example input sequences\nsequences = [&quot;Hello!&quot;, &quot;Cool.&quot;, &quot;Nice!&quot;]\n \n# Tokenization\nencoded_sequences = tokenizer(sequences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;)\nmodel_inputs = torch.tensor(encoded_sequences[&quot;input_ids&quot;])\n \n# Model inference\noutput = model(model_inputs)\n \n# Saving the model\nmodel.save_pretrained(&quot;my_model_directory&quot;)\n \n# Accessing configuration attributes\nprint(config.hidden_size)\nprint(config.num_hidden_layers)\nModels expect a batch of inputs\nBatching involves sending multiple sentences to the model at once.\nsequence = &quot;I&#039;ve been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.&quot;\n \ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(sequence)\nids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)\ninput_ids = torch.tensor(ids)\n# This line will fail.\nmodel(input_ids) # it is single dim array \nSo to work with model we need to pass it as batch as\ninput_ids = torch.tensor([ids]) # we converting in to 2d by  [] enclosing \nprint(&quot;Input IDs:&quot;, input_ids)\n \noutput = model(input_ids)\nprint(&quot;Logits:&quot;, output.logits)\nAnother method of overriding this issue is padding\nPadding the inputs: Sentences in a batch often have different lengths. To address this, padding is used. Padding involves adding a special token called the “padding token” to shorter sentences, making all sentences in the batch the same length. This is essential because tensors require a rectangular shape.\nThe padding token ID can be found in tokenizer.pad_token_id\nAttention masks: When using padding, it’s crucial to use attention masks. Attention masks are tensors that guide the model to focus on the actual tokens and ignore the padding tokens. This ensures accurate results, as attention layers in Transformers models contextualize each token. Without attention masks, padding tokens would be incorrectly considered in the attention mechanism.\nLonger sequences: Transformer models have limitations on the sequence length they can process. Most models handle up to 512 or 1024 tokens. To handle longer sequences:\n\nUtilize models specifically designed for long sequences, such as Longformer or LED.\nTruncate the sequences to the maximum supported length using the max_sequence_length parameter.\n\nTokenzier\nThe process of converting text to numbers is called encoding.\nEncoding involves two steps:\n\nTokenization: splitting text into smaller units (tokens) such as words, characters, or subwords.\nConversion to Input IDs: mapping each token to a unique numerical identifier from the tokenizer’s vocabulary.\n\nAutoTokenizer:\n\nThis class is a more generic tokenizer class that acts as a wrapper, enabling you to load tokenizers for different model architectures without explicitly specifying the tokenizer class.\nIt can intelligently determine the correct tokenizer class based on the model checkpoint name we provide.\nFor instance, if we use AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;bert-base-cased&quot;), it will automatically load the BertTokenizer class because the checkpoint name indicates a BERT model.\n\nMethods\n\ntokenizer(): This method performs the complete encoding process, converting raw text into input IDs.\ntokenize(): This method handles only the tokenization step, splitting the text into tokens.\nconvert_tokens_to_ids(): This method converts a list of tokens into their corresponding numerical IDs.\ndecode(): This method performs the reverse operation of encoding, converting a list of input IDs back into a text string.\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n \n# Load the pre-trained tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;bert-base-cased&quot;)\n \n# Input text\ntext = &quot;This is a sample text for tokenization and decoding.&quot;\n \n# Tokenize the input text\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)\nprint(&quot;Tokens:&quot;, tokens)\n[&quot;this&quot;,&quot;i&quot;,...]\n \n# Convert tokens to input IDs\ninput_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)\nprint(&quot;Input IDs:&quot;, input_ids)\n \n# Decode the input IDs back to text\ndecoded_text = tokenizer.decode(input_ids)\nprint(&quot;Decoded Text:&quot;, decoded_text)\n\nit uses Rust under the hood\n\nPreprocessing the data\nPadding and Truncation: Sentences often have varying lengths. To create uniform input tensors, the tokenizer uses padding (adding a special padding token to shorter sequences) and truncation (shortening sequences that exceed the model’s maximum length).\nbatch_sentences = [\n    &quot;But what about second breakfast?&quot;,\n    &quot;Don&#039;t think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.&quot;,\n    &quot;What about elevensies?&quot;,\n]\nencoded_input = tokenizer(batch_sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;)\nprint(encoded_input)\nTrainer\nTransformers provides a Trainer class optimized for training  Transformers models, making it easier to start training without manually writing your own training loop. The Trainer API supports a wide range of training options and features such as logging, gradient accumulation, and mixed precision.\nThe Trainer is built on PyTorch, so it’s not suitable for projects that use Keras or TensorFlow\nThe Trainer may not be the best choice for highly specialized training logic. In such cases, the Accelerate library offers more fine-grained control.\nHugging Face X Langchain\nlangchain-huggingface\nfrom langchain_huggingface import HuggingFacePipeline\n \nllm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id(\n    model_id=&quot;microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct&quot;,\n    task=&quot;text-generation&quot;,\n    pipeline_kwargs={\n        &quot;max_new_tokens&quot;: 100,\n        &quot;top_k&quot;: 50,\n        &quot;temperature&quot;: 0.1,\n    },\n)\nllm.invoke(&quot;Hugging Face is&quot;)\n \nAccessing the inference on serverless model\nfrom langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint\n \nllm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(\n    repo_id=&quot;meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct&quot;,\n    task=&quot;text-generation&quot;,\n    max_new_tokens=100,\n    do_sample=False,\n)\nllm.invoke(&quot;Hugging Face is&quot;)\n \nhuggingface.co/blog/langchain\nONNX\nONNX is an open format built to represent machine learning models. ONNX defines a common set of operators - the building blocks of machine learning and deep learning models - and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers\nONNX enables exporting trained models from one framework and importing them into another, facilitating seamless transitions between different tools.\nAn ONNX model file contains a graph representing the model’s structure. This graph is a collection of computation nodes, analogous to the layers in a neural network\nEach computation node represents a specific operation, defined by an operator. These operators map to deep learning conventions and encompass functions like activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh), convolutional operations, and more.\nONNX supports standard data types for tensors (int8, int16, bool, float16, etc.) as well as non-tensor types like sequences and maps for traditional machine learning\nONNX Runtime is an open-source inference engine that implements the ONNX standard.

Serves as the front end of the Kubernetes control plane.\nScheduler: Places containers according to resource requirements and metrics. Makes note of Pods with no assigned node, and selects nodes for them to run on.\nController manager: Runs controller processes and reconciles the cluster’s actual state with its desired specifications. Manages controllers such as node controllers, endpoints controllers,replica,statefulset,cron and replication controllers.\nKubelet: Ensures that containers are running in a Pod by interacting with the Docker engine , the default program for creating and managing containers. Takes a set of provided PodSpecs and ensures that their corresponding containers are fully operational.\nKube-proxy: Manages network connectivity and maintains network rules across nodes. Implements the Kubernetes Service concept across every node in a given cluster.\nEtcd: Stores all cluster data like how many pod and there replica count .

At a high-level they do three things:\n\nWatch the API Server for new work assignments\nExecute new work assignments\nReport back to the control plane (via the API server)\n\nNodes contain\n\n\nKubelet →When you join a new node to a cluster, the process installs kubelet onto the node. The kubelet is then responsible for registering the node with the cluster. Registration effectively pools the node’s CPU, memory, and storage into the wider cluster pool. One of the main jobs of the kubelet is to watch the API server for new work assignments. Any time it sees one, it executes the task and maintains a reporting channel back to the control plane.\n\n\nContainer runtime →The Kubelet needs a container runtime to perform container-related tasks things like pulling images and starting and stopping containers.There are lots of container runtimes available for Kubernetes. One popular example is cri-containerd .\n\n\nKube-proxy →This runs on every node in the cluster and is responsible for local cluster networking. For example, it makes sure each node gets its own unique IP address, and implements local IPTABLES or IPVS rules to handle routing and load-balancing of traffic on the Pod network.\n\n\nResources mangement\nWhen the node is running out of the resources for the pod. it will kill the pod that does not have resources mentioned in deployment file.\nPods (it’s just a sandbox for hosting containers.)\nThe simplest model is to run a single container per Pod. However, there are advanced use-cases that run multiple containers inside a single Pod. An infrastructure-centric use-case for multi-container Pods is a service mesh.\nPod lifecycle\nPods are mortal. They’re created, they live, and they die. If they die unexpectedly, you don’t bring them back to life. Instead, Kubernetes starts a new one in its place\nHow do we deploy Pods\nTo deploy a Pod to a Kubernetes cluster you define it in a manifest file and POST that manifest file to the API Server. The control panel verifies the configuration of the YAML file, writes it to the cluster store as a record of intent, and the scheduler deploys it to a healthy node with enough available resources. This process is identical for single-container Pods and multi-container Pods.\nWe can also run the Pod directly mention the docker image kubctl run podName --image=nignix:alpline\nPods and cgroups\nAt a high level, Control Groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel technology that prevents individual containers from consuming all of the available CPU, RAM and IOPS on a node. You could say that cgroups actively police resource usage.Individual containers have their own cgroup limits.\nPod manifest files\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n\tname: hello-pod\n\tlabels:\n\tzone: prod\n\tversion: v1\nspec:\n\tcontainers:\n\t- name: hello-ctr\n\timage: nigelpoulton/k8sbook:latest\n\tports:\n\t- containerPort: 8080\n\n\nThe .apiVersion field tells you two things – the API group and the API version.\n\n\n.kind field tells Kubernetes the type of object is being deployed.\n\n\n.metadata section is where you attach a name and labels These help you identify the object in the cluster, as well as create loose couplings between different objects. You can also define the Namespace that an object should be deployed to. Keeping things brief, Namespaces are a way to logically divide a cluster into multiple virtual clusters for management purposes. In the real world, it’s highly recommended to use namespaces, however, you should not think of them as strong security boundaries.\n\n\nThe .spec section is where you define the containers that will run in the Pod.\n\n\nkubectl apply -f pod.yml →command to POST the manifest to the API server.\n\n\nkubectl get pods →command to check the status.\n\n\nkubectl get pods hello-pod -o yaml → To get more details about pod\n\n\nkubectl describe pods hello-pod →This provides a nicely formatted multi-line overview of an object. It even includes some important object lifecycle events.\n\n\nkubectlexec -it hello-pod --sh →command will log-in to the first container\n\n\nPod Auto Scalling\nTypes\n\nCluster  (add more nodes when then cluster is full)\nHorizontal pod autoscale (scale up pod up and down based on metrics)\nVertical pod autoscale (increase the resoures limit tool avalible for vertical pod autoscaler)\nkeda (event driven autoscalling)\n\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):\napiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2\nkind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\nmetadata:\n  name: my-app-hpa\nspec:\n  scaleTargetRef:\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: my-app-deployment\n  minReplicas: 2\n  maxReplicas: 10\n  metrics:\n  - type: Resource\n    resource:\n      name: cpu\n      targetAverageUtilization: 50\n \n \n# this will scale the pod based on no of request\nmetrics:  \n- type: Pods  \npods:  \nmetric:  \nname: http_requests  \ntarget:  \ntype: AverageValue  \naverageValue: 1000\nReplicaSet\nTo deploy multiple instance. A ReplicaSet is defined with fields, including a selector that specifies how to identify Pods it can acquire, a number of replicas indicating how many Pods it should be maintaining, and a pod template specifying the data of new Pods it should create to meet the number of replicas criteria. A ReplicaSet then fulfills its purpose by creating and deleting Pods as needed to reach the desired number. When a ReplicaSet needs to create new Pods, it uses its Pod template.\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: ReplicaSet\nmetadata:\nname: frontend\nlabels:\n  app: guestbook\n  tier: frontend\nspec:\nreplicas: 3\nselector:\n  matchLabels:\n    tier: frontend\ntemplate:\n  metadata:\n    labels:\n      tier: frontend\n  spec:\n    containers:\n    - name: php-redis\n      image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3\nDeployments vs ReplicaSet\nDeployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features. Therefore, we recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets\nCMD\n\nkubectl get rs → get all replica\n\nDeployments\nDeploy Pods indirectly via a higher-level controller. Examples of higher-level controllers include; Deployments, DaemonSets, and StatefulSets.\nFor example, a Deployment is a higher-level Kubernetes object that wraps around a particular Pod and adds features such as scaling, zero-downtime updates, and versioned rollbacks.\nBehind the scenes, Deployments, DaemonSets and StatefulSets implement a controller and a watch loop that is constantly observing the cluster making sure that current state matches desired state.\nDepolyment strategies\nto manage the rollout and updates of applications within a cluster. These strategies help in achieving continuous delivery, minimizing downtime, and ensuring reliability.\nRolling Update Deployment (default)\n\nThis strategy gradually replaces old pods with new ones, ensuring that there is always a specified number of replicas available.\n\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-deployment\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  strategy:\n    type: RollingUpdate\n    rollingUpdate:\n      maxUnavailable: 1 \n      maxSurge: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: example-container\n        image: example:new-version\n \n\nmaxUnavailable → maximum number or percentage of pods that can be unavailable during the update\nmaxSurge → maximum number or percentage of pods that can be created above the desired replica count during the update\n\nRecreate Deployment:\n\nIn this strategy, the existing pods are terminated all at once, and new pods with the updated version are created.\nhave down time (used on dev )\n\nBlue-Green Deployment:\n\nthere are two separate environments (blue and green), and the traffic is switched between them after a successful update.\n\nCanary Deployment:\n\ndeployment introduces the new version of the application to a subset of users or traffic.\n\nDifference between pod and Deployments\nPods don’t self-heal, they don’t scale, and they don’t allow for easy updates or rollbacks. Deployments do all of these. As a result, you’ll almost always deploy Pods via a Deployment controller.\nDesired state is what you want. Current state is what you have. If the two match, everybody’s happy.\nThe declarative model is a way of telling Kubernetes what your desired state is, without having to get into the detail of how to implement it. You leave the how up to Kubernetes.\nReconciliation loops\nFundamental to desired state is the concept of background reconciliation loops (a.k.a. control loops). For example, ReplicaSets implement a background reconciliation loop that is constantly checking whether the right number of Pod replicas are present on the cluster. If there aren’t enough, it adds more. If there are too many, it terminates some. To be crystal clear, Kubernetes is constantly making sure that current state matches desired state.\nRolling updates with Deployments\nNow, assume you’ve experienced a bug, and you need to deploy an updated image that implements a fix. To do this, you update the same Deployment YAML file with the new image version and re-POST it to the API server. This registers a new desired state on the cluster, requesting the same number of Pods, but all running the new version of the image. To make this happen, Kubernetes creates a new ReplicaSet for the Pods with the new image.You now have two ReplicaSets – the original one for the Pods with the old version of the image, and a new one for the Pods with the updated version. Each time Kubernetes increases the number of Pods in the new ReplicaSet (with the new version of the image) it decreases the number of Pods in the old ReplicaSet (with the old versionof the image). Net result, you get a smooth rolling update with zero downtime.\nDeployments manifest files\napiVersion: apps/v1 #Older versions of k8s use apps/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nname: hello-deploy\nspec:\n\treplicas: 10\n\tselector:\n\t\tmatchLabels:\n\t\tapp: hello-world\n\tminReadySeconds: 10\n\tstrategy:\n\t\ttype: RollingUpdate\n\t\trollingUpdate:\n\t\tmaxUnavailable: 1\n\t\tmaxSurge: 1\n\ttemplate:\n\t\tmetadata:\n\t\tlabels:\n\t\t\tapp: hello-world\n\t\tspec:\n\t\t\tcontainers:\n\t\t\t- name: hello-pod\n\t\t\timage: nigelpoulton/k8sbook:latest\n\t\t\tports:\n\t\t\t- containerPort: 8080\n\t\t\tresources:\n\t\t\t\trequest: (A minimum value)\n\t\t\t\t\tcpu : 1m\n\t\t\t\t\tmemory: 1024Mi (in MB)\n\t\t\t\tlimit: (A maxx value can be used)\n\t\t\t\t\tcpu: 3m\n\t\t\t\t\tmemory: \n\n\nThe .spec section is where most of the action happens.

They help define rules for pod placement based on characteristics of the nodes or other pods in the cluster.\nAffinity: Affinity rules specify conditions that pods prefer for their placement. Pods with affinity rules tend to be scheduled onto nodes that meet those conditions\nAnti-Affinity: Anti-affinity rules, on the other hand, specify conditions that pods should avoid for their placement. Pods with anti-affinity rules tend to be scheduled away from nodes or pods that meet those conditions\nIt is use full when we need high avaliblity of the server in different node\nYaml file explained\nAPI Version\nspecifies the version of the Kubernetes API that should be used for the resource described in that file.The format of the apiVersion field is typically &lt;group&gt;/&lt;version&gt;\nType of groups\n\nCore API Group (v1): Resources like Pod, Service, Namespace, PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, etc. use  apiVersion: v1\nApps API Group (apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, apps/v1beta2): for managing higher-level abstractions of applications and workloads, including Deployment, StatefulSet, ReplicaSet, and DaemonSet.\nBatch API Group (batch/v1, batch/v1beta1): related to batch processing, such as Job and CronJob.\nNetworking API Group (networking.k8s.io/v1, networking.k8s.io/v1beta1): related to networking, including NetworkPolicy.\n\nKind\nThe type of resource being defined.\n\nPod:\n\nRepresents a single instance of a running process in a cluster.\n\n\nService:\n\nDefines a set of Pods and a policy to access them as a network service.\n\n\nReplicationController:\n\nEnsures a specified number of replicas for a set of Pods.

The spec section contains the configuration parameters and settings that specify how the resource should behave. The structure of the spec field varies depending on the type of resource being defined, as each resource type has its own set of properties and specifications.\nExample\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: test-certbot\n  namespace: nginx-ingress\n  labels:\n    app: certbot\n    environment: test\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: certbot\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: certbot\n        environment: test\n    spec:\n      securityContext:\n            fsGroup: 1000\n            runAsUser: 1000\n      containers:\n        - name: certbot\n          image: test-certbot:latest\n          command: [&quot;node&quot;]\n          args: [&quot;server.js&quot;]\n\n\nKuberentes apply from bottom first it will create a 2 pod with label certbot\nThen replica will be created to monitor the pod status does is have 2 active pod by using selector\nThen depolyment will be created\n\nWhat happend when we apply yml file\nwhen we run kubctl apply -f name.yml\n\nThe kubectl command communicates with the Kubernetes API server.The API server performs several tasks, including authentication, authorization, validation, and admission control. Once the YAML file has passed validation and admission control, the API server persists the resource information in etcd.\nControllers in Kubernetes operate on a watch loop. They continuously watch for changes in the desired state of resources by querying etcd for updates.When a new resource is stored in etcd, controllers that are responsible for that resource type are notified.\nBased on the reconciled desired state, controllers initiate actions to bring the cluster to the desired state. In the case of a Deployment, this may involve creating new Pods to meet the specified replica count.\nController store the Pod object to etcd then the Scheduler is responsible for assigning Pods to available nodes in the cluster.It selects an appropriate node based on factors such as available resources, node affinity/anti-affinity rules, and other constraints specified in the Pod’s configuration\nNext Kubelet get notified for actually creating and managing the containers within Pods\nOnce Kubelet run the pod sucessfully it update the status on etcd.\n\nProbe\n\nLiveness Probe indicates if the container is operating. If so, no action is taken. If not, the kubelet kills and restarts the container. Liveness probes are used to tell kubernetes to restart a container. If the liveness probe fails, the application will restart. This can be used to catch issues such as a deadlock and make your application more available.\nReadiness Probe indicates whether the application running in the container is ready to accept requests. If so, Services matching the pod are allowed to send traffic to it. If not, the endpoints controller removes the pod from all matching Kubernetes Services.Note:If you don’t set the readiness probe, the kubelet assumes that the app is ready to receive traffic as soon as the container starts. If the container takes 2 minutes to start, all the requests to it will fail for those 2 minutes.\nStartup Probe indicates whether the application running in the container has started. If so, other probes start functioning. If not, the kubelet kills and restarts the container.\n\n readinessProbe:\n  httpGet:\n\tpath: /ready\n\tport: 80\n\thttpHeaders:  \n\t\tname: X-Custom-Header  \n\t\tvalue: &quot;CustomValue&quot;\n \n#we can give as exec like below\nlivenessProbe:  \n  exec:  \n\tcommand:  \n\t- sh  \n\t- -c  \n\t- &quot;nc -z localhost 5432 || exit 1&quot;\nServices\nWhen newly pods created are scaled it will have new IP so if we have other pod communicating with it. it is unrealible.This is where Services come in to play. Services provide reliable networking for a set of Pods.\nThey operate at the TCP and UDP layer, Services do not possess application intelligence and cannot provide application-layer host and path routing.for that we use ingress\nServices use labels and a label selector to know which set of Pods to load-balance traffic to.\nkube-proxy is responsible for all assign the IP , forwarding packet, load balancing etc.\nproxy_pass http://SERVICE-NAME.YOUR-NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local:8080;\ncan be accessed\nKube Proxy\ninstalled on every node and runs in our cluster in the form of a DaemonSet.\nHow it works\nAfter Kube-proxy is installed, it authenticates with the API server. When new Services or endpoints are added or removed, the API server communicates these changes to the Kube-Proxy.\nKube-Proxy then applies these changes as NAT rules inside the node. These NAT rules are simply mappings of Service IP to Pod IP. When a request is sent to a Service, it is redirected to a backend Pod based on these rules.\nNow let’s get into more details with an example.\nAssume we have a Service SVC01 of type ClusterIP. When this Service is created, the API server will check which Pods to be associated with this Service. So, it will look for Pods with labels that match the Service’s label selector.\nLet’s call these Pod01 and Pod02. Now the API server will create an abstraction called an endpoint. Each endpoint represents the IP of one of the Pods. SVC01 is now tied to 2 endpoints that correspond to our Pods. Let’s call these EP01 and EP02.\nNow the API server maps the IP address of SVC01 to 2 IP addresses, EP01 and EP0 and API server advertises the new mapping to the Kube-proxy on each node, which then applies it as an internal rule.\nKube-Proxy can operate in three different modes, user-space mode, IPtables mode, and IPVS mode.\n\nuser-space mode not used now IPtables and IPVS  are used now where iptables are timeconsuming compared to IPVS to lookup o(n)\n\nBy default, Kube-proxy runs on port 10249 and exposes a set of endpoints that you can use to query Kube-proxy for information.\nwe can use the /proxyMode endpoint to check the kube-proxy mode.\nTypes\nClusterIP (default)\n\nhas a stable IP address and port that is only accessible from inside the cluster\nIt will get registered in kube DNS and when every Pod IP change kube will take care of it so we can just use the service name to communicate\n\nService YAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n\tname: hello-svc #Name registered with cluster DNS\nspec:\n\tports:\n\t- port: 8080 #the port the service need to be listen\n    targetPort: 8080 # the port the app is running\n\tselector:\n\t\tapp: hello-world\n\t\t# Label selector\n\t\t# Service is looking for Pods with the label `app=hello-world` can be any key and vaule\n \ndeploy.yml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n\tname: hello-deploy\nspec:\n\treplicas: 10\n\tselector:\n\t\tmatchLabels:\n\t\t\tapp: hello-world\ntemplate:\n\tmetadata:\n\t\tlabels:\n\t\t\tapp: hello-world\n\t\t\t# Pod labels\n\t\t\t# The label matches the Service&#039;s label selector\n\tspec:\n\t\tcontainers:\n\t\t- name: hello-ctr\n\n\nthe Service has a label selector ( .spec.selector ) with a single value app=hello-world  This is the label that the Service is looking for when it queries the cluster for matching Pods.\n\n\nThe Deployment specifies a Pod template with the same app=hello-world label ( .spec.template.metadata.labels )\n\n\nthe Service will select all 10 Pod replicas and provide them with a stable networking endpoint and load-balance traffic to them.\n\n\nkubectl get services → Will list all service with IP get the IP from here\n\n\nTo connect with service user the service name or ip by kubectl get services\n\n\nRedis(host=&quot;servicename&quot;,port=&quot;8080&quot;) in code level to acess the Pod\n\n\nHeadless service:\n\nSometimes you don’t need load-balancing and a single Service IP. In this case, you can create what are termed headless Services, by explicitly specifying &quot;None&quot; for the  cluster IP address\nThis also help us if we want to pod to pod communication\nNodePort service:\nThis builds on top of ClusterIP and enables access from outside of the cluster (static ip).

Any new Pods that match the selector get added to the Endpoints object, and any Pods that disappear get removed. This means the Endpoints object is always up to date. Then, when a Service is sending traffic to Pods, it queries its Endpoints object for the latest list of healthy matching Pods. Every Service gets its own Endpoints object with the same name as the Service.This object holds a list of all the Pods the Service matches and is dynamically updated as matching Pods come and go.\nCMD\n\nkubectl get pod -o wide → will display the IP\nkubectl apply -f svc.yml →Tells Kubernetes to deploy a new object from a file called svc.yml . The .kind field in the YAML file tells Kubernetes that you’re deploying a new Service object.\nkubectl get svc hello-svc →Introspecting Services display the IP\nkubectl get ep hello-svc →the Endpoint controller’s\n\nKubernetes DNS\nEvery Pod on the cluster, meaning all containers and Pods know how to find it. Every new service is automatically registered with the cluster’s DNS so that all components in the cluster can find every Service by name. Some other components that are registered with the cluster DNS are StatefulSets and the individual Pods that a StatefulSet manages.Cluster DNS is based on CoreDNS (coredns.io/).\nNetwork policies\nBy default all pod can communicate with other even in different namespace just by knowing the IP. If we want restrict that use network policies\nNetworking\nWhen we create a Kubernetes Service, it gets assigned a Cluster IP (also known as a virtual IP). This Cluster IP is managed by iptables on each node in the cluster.\nHere’s how iptables is typically used in Kubernetes for routing traffic to different pods:\n\nService Cluster IP Routing:\n\nWhen you create a Service in Kubernetes, it gets assigned a Cluster IP, which is an internal IP address.\niptables rules are automatically configured on each node in the cluster to forward traffic destined to the Service’s Cluster IP to one of the Service’s endpoints (Pods).\nThese iptables rules typically reside in the nat table and are managed by kube-proxy, which runs on each node in the cluster.\nkube-proxy watches the Kubernetes API server for changes to Services and Endpoints, and it updates iptables rules accordingly to ensure that traffic is properly routed to the appropriate Pods.\n\n\nService External Traffic Routing:\n\nIn addition to routing internal traffic within the cluster, iptables can also be used to route external traffic to Services.\nWhen you expose a Service externally (e.g., using a NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress), iptables rules are configured to forward external traffic to the appropriate Service Cluster IP.\n\n\nPod-to-Pod Communication:\n\niptables rules are also used for enabling communication between different Pods in the cluster.\nKubernetes assigns a unique IP address to each Pod, and iptables rules are configured to allow communication between Pods within the same namespace or across namespaces if Network Policies allow.\n\n\nNetwork Policies:\n\nNetwork Policies in Kubernetes allow you to define rules for controlling traffic to and from Pods.\niptables rules are used to enforce these Network Policies, allowing or blocking traffic based on the defined rules.\n\n\n\nIPTable\niptables -t nat -L -n →displays the current NAT (Network Address Translation) table rules the output contain\n\nChain (Chain name):\n\nEach line starts with the chain name, which indicates the specific chain within the NAT table where the rule is applied. Common chains include PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, and OUTPUT.\nPREROUTING → apply the rule before routing,POSTROUTING → after routing and OUTPUT is for when the packets send to externam\n\n\nnum:\n\nThe num column displays the sequential number of the rule within the chain. This number is used for referencing and managing rules.\n\n\ntarget:\n\nThe target column indicates the target action to be taken when a packet matches the rule. Common targets include DNAT, SNAT, MASQUERADE, REDIRECT, etc.\nDNAT (Destination Network Address Translation) is used to rewrite the destination IP address and/or port of packets as they pass through the firewall.\nSNAT is used to rewrite the source IP address and/or port of packets as they pass through the firewall\nMASQUERADE is a special case of SNAT and is commonly used when the outbound interface’s IP address is dynamically assigned (e.g., using DHCP).\nREDIRECT is used to redirect packets to the local machine itself, typically to a different port on the same machine.\n\n\nprot:\n\nThe prot column specifies the protocol (e.g., tcp, udp) for which the rule is defined.\n\n\nsource:\n\nThe source column specifies the source IP address or IP range from which packets are matched against the rule.\n\n\ndestination:\n\nThe destination column specifies the destination IP address or IP range to which packets are matched against the rule.\n\n\noptions:\n\nThe options column provides additional options or flags associated with the rule. This may include port numbers, interface names, etc.\n\n\nOriginal and Translated IP addresses/ports:\n\nFor DNAT and SNAT rules, you may see columns indicating the original and translated IP addresses or ports. These columns show the transformation that occurs on the packet’s source or destination IP address or port.\n\n\n\nNote: use ip command\nKubernetes storage\nWhen we restart the pod the data stored in pod will go. To solve this we using Kubernetes storage\nStorage for single pod\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: local-web\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels: \n      app: local-web\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: local-web\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: local-web\n        image: nginx\n        ports:\n          - name: web\n            containerPort: 80\n        volumeMounts:\n          - name: local -&gt; label must need to match with voulme\n            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html #Path inside the container\n      volumes:\n      - name: local\n        hostPath:\n          path: /var/nginxserver\n\nWhen we store data in /usr/share/nginx/html in this dir it will be stored in /var/nginxserver this kind of storage cannot be shared among the pod and nodes\n\nShared storage\nThe three main resources in the persistent volume subsystem are:\n\nPersistent Volumes (PV)\nStorage Classes (SC) → Type of storage class ex NFS,AWS,azure..etc\nPersistent Volume Claims (PVC) → used to claim the storage that was alloacted using PV\n\n\n\nFirst create PV with following\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolume\nmetadata:\n  name: nfs\nspec:\n  capacity:\n    storage: 500Mi\n\tpersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain\n  accessModes:\n\t    - ReadWriteMany \n  storageClassName: nfs #type of storage that we using\n  nfs:\n    server: 192.168.1.7\n    path: &quot;/srv/nfs&quot;\n\n.spec.accessModes defines how the PV can be mounted. Three options exist:\n\nReadWriteOnce (RWO)\nReadWriteMany (RWM)\nReadOnlyMany(ROM)\nReadWriteOnce defines a PV that can only be mounted/bound as R/W by a single PVC. Attempts from multiple PVCs to bind (claim) it will fail.\nReadWriteMany defines a PV that can be bound as R/W by multiple PVCs. This mode is usually only supported by file and object storage such as NFS. Block storage usually only supports RWO .\nReadOnlyMany defines a PV that can be bound by multiple PVCs as R/O. A couple of things are worth noting. First up, a PV can only be opened\n\n\npersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy This tells Kubernetes what to do with a PV when its PVC has been released. Two policies currently exist:\n\nDelete →This policy deletes the PV and associated storage resource on the external storage system\nRetain\n\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the PV by kubctl -f apply filename.yml\n\nkubctl get pv : to get all PV\nPV are not bound to namespace it can be accesed by any namspace\n\n\n\nCreate PVC to claim the pV\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: mycustomvolume\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteMany\n  storageClassName: nfs #we can create custom storage class \n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 100Mi4\n\n.spec section must match with the PV you are binding it with. In this example, access modes, storage class, and capacity must match with the PV. but the storage can be less then what we give in PV\nIt bound to namespace\nkubctl describe pvc → to describe what’ going on helpfull to debug.\n\n\n\nUse it in deployment\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nfs-web\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels: \n      app: nfs-web\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nfs-web\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nfs-web\n        image: nginx\n        ports:\n          - name: web\n            containerPort: 80\n        volumeMounts:\n          - name: nfs\n            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\n      volumes:\n      - name: mycustomvolume #Label need to match\n        persistentVolumeClaim:\n          claimName: nfs\n\n\nConfig Maps\nKubernetes provides an object called a ConfigMap (CM) that lets you store configuration data outside of a Pod. It also lets you dynamically inject the data into a Pod at run-time. ConfigMaps are a map of key/value pairs and we call each key/value pair an entry.\nExample\n#multimap.yml\nkind: ConfigMap\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n\tname: multimap\ndata:\n\tDB_URL: &quot;&quot; # this can be acessed as var\n\t.env : | # these content stored in file name called .env on pod \n\t\t\tenv = plex-test\n\t\t\tendpoint = 0.0.0.0:31001\n\t\t\tchar = utf8\n\t\t\tvault = PLEX/test\n\t\t\tlog-size = 512M\n\nkubectl apply -f multimap.yml\nUse Pipe (|) to create a as .env file\n\nInjecting ConfigMap data into Pods and containers\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: dapi-test-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: test-container\n      image: registry.k8s.io/busybox\n      command: [ &quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;env&quot; ]\n      env:\n        # Define the environment variable\n        - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY\n          valueFrom:\n            configMapKeyRef:\n              # The ConfigMap containing the value you want to assign to SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY\n              name: multimap\n              # Specify the key associated with the value\n              key: DB_URL\n  \nConfigMaps and volumes\nUsing ConfigMaps with volumes is the most flexible option. You can reference entire configuration files as well as make updates to the ConfigMap and have them reflected in running containers.\n\nCreate the ConfigMap\nCreate a ConfigMap volume in the Pod template\nMount the ConfigMap volume into the container\nEntries in the ConfigMap will appear in the container as individual files\n\nSecretes\nSecrets can be created independently of the Pods that use them, there is less risk of the Secret (and its data) being exposed during the workflow of creating, viewing, and editing Pods. Kubernetes, and applications that run in your cluster, can also take additional precautions with Secrets, such as avoiding writing sensitive data to nonvolatile storage.\nKubernetes Secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server’s underlying data store (etcd). Anyone with API access can retrieve or modify a Secret, and so can anyone with access to etcd. Additionally, anyone who is authorized to create a Pod in a namespace can use that access to read any Secret in that namespace; this includes indirect access such as the ability to create a Deployment.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: dotfile-secret\ndata:\n  .secret-file: dmFsdWUtMg0KDQo=\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: secret-dotfiles-pod\nspec:\n  volumes:\n    - name: secret-volume\n      secret:\n        secretName: dotfile-secret\n  containers:\n    - name: dotfile-test-container\n      image: registry.k8s.io/busybox\n      command:\n        - ls\n        - &quot;-l&quot;\n        - &quot;/etc/secret-volume&quot;\n      volumeMounts:\n        - name: secret-volume\n          readOnly: true\n          mountPath: &quot;/etc/secret-volume&quot;\nStatefulSets\nStatefulSets in Kubernetes are a resource type used to manage stateful applications, particularly those that require unique identities, stable network identifiers, and stable persistent storage. They are used for applications like databases where each instance needs a specific identity and state.\nUsing StatefulSets for MongoDB:\n\nPod Identity: StatefulSets assign stable, predictable identities (like mongo-0, mongo-1, etc.) to each MongoDB instance. This ensures consistency and stability crucial for proper replication and cluster coordination.\nStorage: StatefulSets facilitate the use of persistent volumes, ensuring that each MongoDB instance has its dedicated and persistent storage. Even if a pod fails or needs to be rescheduled, the data remains intact and can be reattached to a new pod with the same identity.\n\nStatefulSet Pod naming\nAll Pods managed by a StatefulSet get predictable and persistent names. These names are vital, and are at the core of how Pods are started, self-healed, scaled, deleted, attached to volumes, and more. The format of StatefulSet Pod names is StatefulSetName-Integer . The integer is a zero-based index ordinal, which is just a fancy way of saying “number starting from 0”\nOrdered creation and deletion\nStatefulSets create one Pod at a time, and always wait for previous Pods to be running and ready before creating the next. This is different from Deployments that use a ReplicaSet controller to start all Pods at the same time,causing potential race conditions.\nDeleting StatefulSets\nFirstly, deleting a StatefulSet does not terminate Pods in order. With this in mind, you may want to scale a StatefulSet to 0 replicas before deleting it. You can also use terminationGracePeriodSeconds to further control the way Pods are terminated. It’s common to set this to at least 10 seconds to give applications running in Pods a chance to flush local buffers and safely commit any writes that are still in-flight.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  labels:\n    app: nginx\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - port: 80\n    name: web\n  clusterIP: None\n  selector:\n    app: nginx\n---\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n  name: web\nspec:\n  serviceName: &quot;nginx&quot;\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: registry.k8s.io/nginx-slim:0.8\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n          name: web\n        volumeMounts:\n        - name: www\n          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\n  volumeClaimTemplates:\n  - metadata:\n      name: www\n    spec:\n      accessModes: [ &quot;ReadWriteOnce&quot; ]\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 1Gi\nMore Example refer here\nKubernetes RBAC\nKubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to define fine-grained access policies for users and services within a Kubernetes cluster.\nAutoScale\nKubectl\nKubectl is the main Kubernetes command-line tool and is what you will use for your day-to-day Kubernetes management activities.\nkubectl configuration file is called config and lives in $HOME/.kube . It contains definitions for:\n• Clusters\n• Users (credentials)\n• Contexts\nClusters is a list of clusters that kubectl knows about and is ideal if you plan on using a single workstation to manage multiple clusters. Each cluster definition has a name, certificate info, and API server endpoint.\nUsers let you define different users that might have different levels of permissions on each cluster. For example, you might have a dev user and an ops user, each with different permissions. Each user definition has a friendly name, a username, and a set of credentials.\nContexts bring together clusters and users under a friendly name. For example, you might have a context called deploy-prod that combines the deploy user credentials with the prod cluster definition. If you use kubectl with this context you will be POSTing commands to the API server of the prod cluster as the deploy user.\nkubctl version → to get version\nkube config file\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n\tcertificate-authority-data: &quot;&quot;\n\tserver: https:/localhost:443 ## master node\n  name: test \ncontexts:\n- context:\n\t cluster: test\n\t user: clusterUser_test_aks_rg_test\n name: test\ncurrent-context: test ## Curren \nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n\t- name: clusterUser_test_aks_rg_test\nuser:\n\tclient-certificate-data: &#039;&#039;\n\tclient-key-data: &#039;&#039;\n\ttoken: &#039;&#039;\n\nkubectl config current-context- tell which context we are accessing currently now\nkubectl config get-context  → to get all context\nkubectl config use-context context-name → to switch the context to different cluster\n\nNamespaces\nUsed to isolate the resources by default it have default namespace\nkubctl get namespace\nkubctl -n nampace_name cmd\nkubectl logs podname\nkubctl exec it podname\nbest practices\nPreventing broken connections during pod shutdown\nWhen a request for a pod deletion is received by the API server, it first modifies the state in etcd and then notifies its watchers of the deletion. Among those watchers are the Kubelet and the Endpoints controller.the pod being removed from the iptables rules when the Endpoints controller recevie notification pod is deleted.\nDuring any client trying to connect to it receives a Connection refused error. to solve this do following\n\nGraceful Termination in Application Code\n\nModify the application code to handle termination signals gracefully. When a container in a pod receives a SIGTERM signal, it’s an indication that the pod is about to be terminated. During the shutdown process, your application should stop accepting new requests and finish processing existing ones\n\n\nPre-Stop Hook\n\nKubernetes supports a pre-stop hook, which is a user-defined script that is executed before a container is terminated.\n\n\nPod Termination Grace Period\n\nspecify a termination grace period (terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30) for a pod, which is the amount of time the system waits for your application to shut down gracefully. During this period, the pod remains in the “Terminating” state, allowing your application to complete any remaining work\n\n\nReadiness Probes:\n\ncan be used to prevent new requests from being directed to a pod\n\n\nService Load Balancing:\n\nDebugging\n\nkubctl debug -it -n pg podname --cop-to newpodname --container containername --image imagename -- /bin/sh → wil copy the pod and shell in to\nEphemeral container kubctl debug -it -n pg podname\n\nLinux namspace\n\nPID (process), NET,MNT(file system),Cgroup,etc all virtual file system\n\nTo see the namspace in kind\n\ndocker ps (get the kind control node)\ndocker exec -it kind-control-plane /bin/bash\nls -l /proc/1/ns/* → print all namespace present in the process\n\nnsenter cmd allow to excute cmd in namespace\nnsenter -net=/proc/$(pgrep -o postgres)/ns/net ss --tcp -l → print all tcp connection in that namespace  is same kubctl exec -it -n pg pg-postrgress -ss --tcp -l\nephemeral containers: a special type of container that runs temporarily in an existing Pod to accomplish user-initiated actions such as troubleshooting.

Next, the Kubernetes scheduler evaluates node resources and schedules the pod to a suitable node based on its resource requests, ensuring it has sufficient allocatable resources. Finally, the kubelet on the designated node enforces resource requests and limits using Linux cgroups, controlling CPU and memory allocation, and potentially evicting pods if resource contention occurs.\nWhile Kubernetes effectively manages resources like CPU and memory, other resources like open file descriptors, TCP connections, and process IDs (PIDs) are not directly managed by Kubernetes\n\nAllocating more is bad it will use other who required may not get the required resources\nvertical pod auto scaller\n\nkarpenter.sh/\ngithub.com/kubernetes/autoscaler\nstormforge.io/pricing/\nIn Kubernetes, QoS classes help manage resources and ensure predictable application behavior. These classes provide a way to isolate, prioritize, and apply resource quotas to different workloads within a cluster.\nThere are three main QoS classes in Kubernetes:\n1.Guaranteed: This class offers the highest level of resource assurance. Pods in this class have their CPU and memory requests equal to their limits. Kubernetes guarantees these pods will receive the requested resources.35\n2.Burstable: Pods in this class have their CPU and memory requests lower than their limits. These pods are guaranteed to receive the resources specified in their requests but can burst up to their limits if resources are available.35\n3.BestEffort: Pods in this class do not specify any resource requests or limits. They run with the lowest priority and utilize leftover resources.\nnode reserver some cpu for himslef\n\n\n1 CPU = 1 core.\n\n\n1 CPU = 1,000,000 micro-CPUs (μCPU).\n\n\n1 CPU means 1 whole CPU core.\n\n\n500m CPU means 0.5 of a CPU core (500 millicores).\n\n\nrestart policy\n\n\nwhen pod uses more memory we allocated it will will killed but for cpu it will throtled\n\n\nwe have  a node with 8Gb two pod with 3Gb and 2Gb using but we set request as 3 for both if new pod we put 3GB kube dont allocate eventhough it is free because it look for unscheduled memory\nnow if we put 6Gi and 6G for both request resour pod it will allow becuase it will look for request size\n\nHow pod killed when memory fulled?\n\nif ten containers are set to use one CPU each (—cpus=1) on a machine with only one CPU, they will all share that single CPU.

Here’s how it works:\n\n\nDefine data models with type hints: Pydantic allows you to create classes that represent the structure of your desired output using Python type hints.\n\n\nAutomatic validation and parsing: When you pass data to a Pydantic model, it automatically validates the data against the defined types and converts it to the appropriate Python objects.\n\n\nSeamless integration with OpenAI function calling: Pydantic models can be easily converted to JSON schema, which can be used with OpenAI function calling to ensure that the LLM output conforms to your expectations.\n\n\nInstructor and Marvin: Simplifying Pydantic Integration\nLibraries like Instructor and Marvin make it even easier to use Pydantic for structured prompting with LLMs:\n\n\nInstructor focuses on OpenAI function calling and provides a simple way to define Pydantic models as response models for your API calls.\n\n\nMarvin is a more comprehensive framework that supports multiple LLMs and offers additional features, including prompt management and evaluation.\n\n\nOutlines\nGenerate structured JSON using regular expressions (regex) and finite state machines (FSMs). This technique is used in a library called Outlines to make Large Language Model (LLM) inference faster.\n\nStep 1: Convert JSON Schema to a Regular Expression:\n\nFirst, the JSON Schema is translated into a regular expression.\nIf a string generated by the LLM matches this regex, it’s valid according to the schema and can be parsed.\nExample: The JSON schema for a character with a name and age is converted to the regex \\\\{&quot;name&quot;:(&quot;John&quot;|&quot;Paul&quot;),&quot;age&quot;:(20|30)\\\\\\\\}.\n\n\nStep 2: Translate the Regex into a Finite State Machine:\n\nRegular expressions can be represented as FSMs.\nLibraries like interegular can perform this translation.\nThe FSM represents all possible valid JSON strings that conform to the schema.\n\n\nStep 3: Generate JSON from the FSM:\n\nStarting from the initial state of the FSM, the algorithm generates one allowed character at random and transitions to the next state.\nThis process repeats until a final state is reached.\nThe generated string is guaranteed to be valid JSON.\n\n\nStep 4: Token-Based FSM:\n\nLLMs work with tokens, not individual characters.\nThe character-based FSM is transformed into a token-based FSM.\nThis is done by mapping FSM states to allowed token transitions.\n\n\nStep 5: Coalescence (Optimization):\n\nTokenizers often create redundant paths in the FSM where different token sequences lead to the same output string.\nCoalescence exploits this redundancy by merging these paths.\nInstead of sampling each token individually, the algorithm can append longer token words, significantly speeding up generation.\nExample: Instead of generating “n”, “a”, “m”, “e” separately, the algorithm can directly append “name.”\nThis can lead to a 5x speedup compared to traditional structured generation.\n\n\nConsiderations:\n\nWhile coalescence improves speed, different token paths can lead to different LLM states and affect the probability distribution of subsequent tokens.\nCare must be taken to avoid excluding more likely sequences during optimization.\n\n\n\nTokenizers: A tokenizer is a fundamental component in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the tokenizer’s design. Tokenizers are essential for LLMs, as they convert text into a numerical representation that the model can process.\nLogit Generators: LLMs, at their core, are probabilistic models. They don’t deterministically produce a single output but instead assign probabilities to different possible next tokens. These probabilities are represented as logits, which are the raw, unnormalized outputs from the model. A logit generator is the part of the LLM that calculates these logits, reflecting the model’s assessment of how likely each token is to appear next, given the preceding context.\nOpenAI logbits here\nimport OpenAI from &quot;openai&quot;;\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: &quot;user&quot;, content: &quot;Hello!&quot; }],\n    model: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,\n    logprobs: true,\n    top_logprobs: 2,\n    logit_bias={2435:-100, 640:-100}\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices[0]);\n}\n\nmain();\n\n//output \n{\n.....\n  &quot;choices&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;index&quot;: 0,\n      &quot;message&quot;: {\n        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,\n        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello!

The Mention\nPurpose:\nThis is the first step where you address an issue as soon as you notice it. The goal is to bring the behavior or concern to the person’s attention in real-time or as close to it as possible.\nAction:\nPull the person aside for a brief, informal conversation. Mention what you’re noticing without making it a big deal. This is more about awareness than criticism.\n2. The Invitation\nPurpose:\nIf the behavior continues, you move to the next step. Here, you provide more context to help the person understand the pattern of behavior that needs to be addressed.\nAction:\nPresent two or three examples of the behavior that demonstrate it’s not just a one-time occurrence but a pattern. Invite the person to reflect on these examples and consider how they can work on them.\n3. The Conversation\nPurpose:\nThis step involves a deeper discussion. It’s about helping the person understand how their behavior is affecting their goals or the team’s goals.\nAction:\nUse a scheduled meeting, such as a weekly one-on-one, to explore the issue more thoroughly. Guide the person to recognize how the behavior is holding them back and brainstorm ways to improve. The conversation should be constructive and focused on personal and professional growth.\n4. The Boundary\nPurpose:\nAt this stage, it’s essential to set clear expectations for change. The goal is to establish an agreement on what needs to be done and by when.\nAction:\nMake a concrete agreement about the changes that need to occur. Specify the timeline for these changes and the specific actions the person commits to taking. Both parties should be clear on the expectations moving forward.\n5.

If it gets the lock, it starts relaying jobs from all partitions of this topic.\n\nHashnode’s Overall Architecture\n\nThey caching mechanism\n\npage cache using next js\nAPI cache using GraphQL Edge Caching with Stellate and Serverless Function Caching with Vercel\n\n\n\nScaling Cron Monitoring\n\n\nThey have Relay which listen for check in and other event from cron and push to kafa\n\n\nSentry Django application will consume from and do the heavy lifting of storing and processing those check-ins\n\n\nTo inform the user about missed check in they written a job which run for a minute and checks on table whether it has check in if it not inform the user but it have 2 problem\n\nAssume due to overload in kafa consumer get consumed later but the job runs before and assume it has not checked in\nDuring deploys of the celery beat scheduler, there is a short period where tasks may be skipped.\n\n\n\nTheir solution involved leveraging the timestamp of each check-in message to determine when all check-ins up to a minute boundary had been processed. They tracked the last time a minute boundary was crossed based on these timestamps. Once they reached a new minute boundary, they knew all check-ins before that moment had been consumed.\nFor instance, imagine a sequence of check-in messages with timestamps:\n\nMessage 1: Timestamp 12:03:20\nMessage 2: Timestamp 12:03:45\nMessage 3: Timestamp 12:04:02\n\nWhen Message 3 arrives, it crosses the minute boundary of 12:04. This signals that all check-ins before 12:04 have been processed. This event becomes the trigger to generate tasks for detecting missing check-ins, eliminating the need for periodic celery beat tasks. This way, they avoid skipping tasks during deployment and accurately detect missed check-ins even during Kafka backlog scenarios.\n\n\n An overview of Cloudflare’s logging pipeline\n\n\nThey used BSD syslog protocol to send the log from system\n\n\n Syslog-ng  is a daemon that implements the aforementioned BSD syslog protocol.

For both cBPF and eBPF programs, the  kernel  statically  analyzes  the programs  before loading them, in order to ensure that they cannot harm the running system.\neBPF extends cBPF in multiple ways, including the  ability  to  call  a\nfixed set of in-kernel helper functions (via the BPF_CALL opcode extension provided by eBPF) and access shared data structures such  as  eBPF maps.\nBCC make bpf program easier to write\niotop → tell which process doing more io\nEBF  → take a system call\nEBF projects\n\nKatran by facebook (l4 loadbalancer)\ncillium (networking sercurity and load balancing for k8)\nbcc,bpftrace (netflix perf troubleshooting)\nandroid security (google andrioid bpf)\ntraffice optimizaiton cloudfare\nfalco container runtime security\n\ntanelpoder.com/psnapper/\nBCC allow python to write epbf\nCMDs\n\nps -eLf | awk ‘{print $8}’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\nps -eLo state,user | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\nps -eo s,user | grep ^[RD] | sort | uniq -c | sort -nbr | head -20 → Runnable state and Uninterruptible sleep\nps -eo s,user,cmd | grep ^[RD] | sort | uniq -c | sort -nbr | head -20\n\n\nCheck how many threads are in R state\n\nTool\n\ngithub.com/tanelpoder/0xtools (do profile on proc file for 5 sec and show the top result)\ngithub.com/iovisor/bcc\n\npchar -measures  the  characteristics/speed  of  the network path between two Internet hosts, on either IPv4 or IPv6 networks it use tracrroute. it tell bandwidth between each router\nlSOF\nlist open files\n\nlsof -i tcp:80 → the process used port 80 -i → internet\nlsof -P processid → give all open files by the process\n\n ## USE method\n Use mehod are used to find bottel necks in the system\n - Utilization is the percentage of time that the resource is busy servicing work during a specific time interval\n - Saturation refers to the degree to which a resource is being overused.disk saturation measures the length of the disk queue, indicating how many I/O requests are waiting to be serviced.\n - Errors in terms of the USE method refer to the count of error events\nThe first step in the USE method is to create a list of resources. in the system like cpu,memory, etc\nqueue.acm.org/detail.cfm\nThe command sync; echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches is used to clear the cache in Linux.\nHere’s a breakdown of what each part of the command does:\n\nsync: This command flushes the file system buffer, ensuring that all data is written to disk.\necho 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches: This command writes the value 1 to the file /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches, which is a special file in Linux that controls the cache behavior.\n\nStorage\nLinux makes it easy to see the actual storage disks by representing them as files in the /dev directory. Each disk is identified by a series of letters.\n\nsd = storage disk\na or b = first or second disk (it also counts c, d, etc.)\n1 or 2 = partitions on the disk (it also counts higher)\n\nThe result is that /dev/sdb1 is storage device ( sd), second device ( b), first partition ( 1), or the first partition on the second storage device.\nUse the ls command to display the contents of the /dev/disk directory. In Ubuntu, you can view storage devices by-id, by-path, etc. You should see at least one entry that reads sda. That’s the first storage disk in the system. When you add a second disk, it will be labeled as sdb. Other identifiers include the disk’s Universally Unique ID (UUID).\nPartition\nA partition is a defined storage area on a hard drive. Essentially, it’s a way of dividing a physical disk into separate, distinct sections. Each partition can be treated as an independent disk by the operating system.\nisstat\nSystem performance steps\nUptime\nlook for the load average field.  It represents the average number of processes that are waiting to be executed by the CPU over a certain period.\n&gt;uptime\n09:37:45 up 13:09,  1 user,  load average: 0.13, 0.40, 0.50\n\n\nFirst number (0.13): The load average over the last 1 minute.\nSecond number (0.40): The load average over the last 5 minutes.\nThird number (0.50): The load average over the last 15 minutes.\n\nInterpretation:\n\n0.0-0.5: The system is idle or lightly loaded.\n0.5-1.0: The system is moderately loaded, with some processes waiting for CPU time.\n1.0-2.0: The system is heavily loaded, with many processes waiting for CPU time.\nAbove 2.0: The system is extremely loaded, with a high risk of performance issues or crashes.\n\nvmstat\n provides a snapshot of the system’s memory, swap, I/O, and CPU usage.\n&gt;vmstat\nprocs -----memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system----cpu-----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st\n 1  0      0 20291856 747012 5818664    0    0    36    50  234  224  7  2 91  0  0\n\nCMD to print in proper table format\nvmstat  | tail -n 1 | awk &#039;{print &quot;| procs | r (run queue) | &quot;$1&quot; |\\n| procs | b (uninterruptible sleep) | &quot;$2&quot; |\\n| memory | swpd (swap used) | &quot;$3&quot; |\\n| memory | free (free memory) | &quot;$4&quot; |\\n| memory | buff (buffer memory) | &quot;$5&quot; |\\n| memory | cache (cache memory) | &quot;$6&quot; |\\n| swap | si (swap in) | &quot;$7&quot; |\\n| swap | so (swap out) | &quot;$8&quot; |\\n| io | bi (blocks read) | &quot;$9&quot; |\\n| io | bo (blocks written) | &quot;$10&quot; |\\n| system | in (interrupts) | &quot;$11&quot; |\\n| system | cs (context switches) | &quot;$12&quot; |\\n| cpu | us (user mode) | &quot;$13&quot;% |\\n| cpu | sy (system mode) | &quot;$14&quot;% |\\n| cpu | id (idle) | &quot;$15&quot;% |\\n| cpu | wa (waiting for I/O) | &quot;$16&quot;% |\\n| cpu | st (steal mode) | &quot;$17&quot;% |&quot;}&#039;\n\n\nprocs\n\nr: The number of processes waiting for CPU time (run queue).\nb: The number of processes in uninterruptible sleep (usually waiting for I/O).\nmemory\nswpd: The amount of swap space used (in kilobytes).\nfree: The amount of free memory available (in kilobytes).\nbuff: The amount of memory used for buffers (in kilobytes).\ncache: The amount of memory used for caching (in kilobytes).\nswap\nsi: The number of kilobytes swapped in from disk per second.\nso: The number of kilobytes swapped out to disk per second.\nio\nbi: The number of blocks read from disk per second.\nbo: The number of blocks written to disk per second.\nsystem\nin: The number of interrupts per second.\ncs: The number of context switches per second.\ncpu\nus: The percentage of CPU time spent in user mode.\nsy: The percentage of CPU time spent in system mode.\nid: The percentage of CPU time spent idle.\nwa: The percentage of CPU time spent waiting for I/O.\nst: The percentage of CPU time spent in steal mode (usually due to virtualization).\n\nTO get no of system call used by the program\nsudo strace  -c  node filename.js → will print all sys call and time it take"},"notes/2024/Low-level-Tech":{"title":"Low level Tech","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Resources\n\nA minimal GPU implementation in Verilog optimized for learning about how GPUs work from the ground up.\n"},"notes/2024/Machine-learning":{"title":"Machine learning","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Machine learning\n\nSupervised learning  → Train data with lables\nUnsupervised learning → FInd pattern in data and create a cluster\nReinforcement learning →based on feedback\n\nSupervised Learning\nRegression\nRegression tasks involve predicting a continuous value for each input data point.

It consists of four elements:\n\nTrue Positive (TP): The number of instances correctly predicted as positive.\nTrue Negative (TN): The number of instances correctly predicted as negative.\nFalse Positive (FP): Also known as Type I error, the number of instances incorrectly predicted as positive.\nFalse Negative (FN): Also known as Type II error, the number of instances incorrectly predicted as negative. A confusion matrix provides insights into the performance of a classification model and can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\nAccuracy: Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances in the dataset. It is calculated as:\nAccuracy= TP + TN / TP + TN +FP +FN​\n\nCost-Sensitive Accuracy: Cost-sensitive accuracy takes into account the costs associated with different types of errors. It assigns different weights or costs to different types of errors based on their importance. For example, in medical diagnosis, the cost of false negatives (missed diagnoses) might be much higher than the cost of false positives (incorrect diagnoses). Cost-sensitive accuracy is calculated by adjusting the weights of TP, TN, FP, and FN accordingly.\nPrecision: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total number of instances predicted as positive.\n\tPrecision = TP / TP + FP\n\nRecall (Sensitivity): Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total number of actual positive instances.\nRecall=TP / TP + FN\n\nF1-Score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

This means that the more memory and processor cores available, the faster MeiliSearch will index new documents. In general, using a machine with many processor cores will be more effective than increasing RAM.By default, all the fields of your documents are considered as “searchable”.\nIn Meilisearch, document storage involves creating specialized inverted indices to facilitate fast responses to search queries. These indices map words or prefixes to the document IDs containing them. While storing documents in raw form is simple, building these indices takes time, especially since some depend on others (e.g., prefix indices depend on word indices).\nSuppose we have a collection of documents:\n\nDocument 1: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”\nDocument 2: “A quick brown dog jumps over the lazy cat.”\nDocument 3: “The lazy dog sleeps all day.”\n\nTo respond quickly to search queries, we create inverted indices. For simplicity, let’s focus on word-based indices:\nWord → Document IDs containing the word\nFor the above documents, the word indices would look something like this:\n\n“The” → [1, 3]\n“quick” → [1, 2]\n“brown” → [1, 2]\n“fox” → [1]\n“jumps” → [1, 2]\n“over” → [1, 2]\n“lazy” → [1, 2, 3]\n“dog” → [1, 3]\n“A” → [2]\n“cat” → [2]\n“sleeps” → [3]\n“all” → [3]\n“day” → [3]\n\nNow, let’s say we want to create prefix indices:\nThese depend on the word indices. For example, if we want to create the prefix index for “qu”, we need to know which documents contain words starting with “qu”, which we can get from the word index.\n\n“q” → [1, 2]\n“qu” → [1, 2]\n“qui” → [1]\n“quic” → [1, 2]\n\nBuilding the prefix index for “quic” requires knowing the document IDs containing words starting with “qu”, which means we need the word index to be built first.\nAdditionally, LMDB’s single-writing-thread limitation means we can’t parallelize updates to these indices without auto-batching, which further complicates the process.\nMeilisearch creates approximately 20 inverted indexes per document index,\nBelow\n  pub word_docids: Database&lt;Str, RoaringBitmapCodec&gt;,\n \n    /// A word and all the documents ids containing the word, from

are three that take the longest time to build: WORD_DOCIDS, WORD_POSITION_DOCID, and WORD_PAIR_PROXIMITY_DOCIDS.\nMeilisearch indexes documents in two main phases\n\nthe first phase is about calculating for filtering for example → this phase is multi-threaded\nthe second phase is about writing the information on disk → this phase is NOT multi-threaded, only one thread does the job, since LMDB (internal DB) does not allow concurrent writings\n\nMeilisearch uses roaring bitmaps widely throughout its inverted indexes to represent document IDs. Roaring bitmaps offer a space-efficient way to store large sets of integers and perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference. These operations play a crucial role in refining search results by allowing the inclusion or exclusion of specific documents based on their relationship with others.\nFinite-state transducer\nA finite-state transducer is also called a word dictionary because it contains all words present in an index. Meilisearch relies on the utilization of two FSTs: one for storing all words of the dataset, and one for storing the most recurrent prefixes.\nFSTs are useful because they support compression and lazy decompression techniques, optimizing memory usage and storage. Additionally, by using automata such as regular expressions, they can retrieve subsets of words that match specific rules or patterns. Moreover, this enables the retrieval of all words that begin with a specific prefix, empowering fast, comprehensive search capabilities.\nR-tree\nR-trees are a type of tree used for indexing multi-dimensional or spatial information. Meilisearch leverages R-trees to power its geo search functionality.\nTokenziation\nTokenization involves two main processes: segmentation and normalization.\nSegmentation consists in splitting a sentence or phrase into smaller units called tokens.\nMeilisearch uses (and maintains) the open-source tokenizer named Charabia. The tokenizer is responsible for retrieving all the words (or tokens) from document fields.\nQuery graph\nEach time it receives a search query, Meilisearch creates a query graph representing the query and its possible variations.\nTo compute these variations, Meilisearch applies concatenation and splitting algorithms to the query terms. The variations considered also include potential typos and synonyms–if the user set them. As an example, let’s examine the query: the sun flower. Meilisearch will also search for the following queries:\n\nthe sunflower: concatenation\nthe sun flowe**d**: substitution\nthe sun flower**s**: addition\n\nNote:  When doing indexing first create setting then do indexing because by default all fileds are searchable which consume more time on indexing\nSend payload in ndjson or CSV format for faster indexing\nRanking rules\nRanking rules are built-in rules that ensure relevancy in search results. MeiliSearch applies ranking rules in a default order which can be changed in the settings. You can add or remove rules and change their order of importance.\nMeiliSearch employs the following order for ranking rules:\n\ntypo\nwords\nproximity\nattribute\nwordsPosition\nexactness\n\nUpdate setting give priority to wordsPosition\nconst index = client.getIndex(&#039;blogs&#039;)\nawait index.updateSettings({\n    rankingRules:\n        [\n            &quot;wordsPosition&quot;,\n            &quot;typo&quot;, \n            &quot;words&quot;, \n            &quot;proximity&quot;, \n            &quot;attribute&quot;,\n            &quot;exactness&quot;\n        ]\n})\nNote:Modifying ranking rules may trigger a reindexing process. Consider the impact and plan accordingly. and we can get the ranking score on search API by passingshowRankingScoreDetails\nfilterable attributes\nfilterable are stroed in Lightning Memory-Mapped Database LMDB uses a B+ tree data structure, which is stored in a single-level store, meaning it doesn’t require additional layers or caching mechanisms to manage the data.\nStoring Faceted/Filtered Values:\nKey-Value Structure:\n\nKey: Faceted/filtered value.\nValue: Internal document ID stored in a RoaringBitmap, forming an inverted index.\n\nExample: For a document with a field color and value blue, the key is the field ID followed by the string blue, and the value is the document ID.\n Roaring bitmap\nInverted index need to store the index Id of the document if we have 5 id for each integer 5 * 32 = 160 bytes of space need to optimize this meili using Roaring bitmap for storing the doc id.\nRoaring bitmaps breaks up all integers in buckets of 2¹⁶ integers(65535). These buckets are called container. It stores individual container data in 3 different formats based on heuristics. Hence its hybrid compression.\nThree different type of storage containers used:\n\nArray container\n\nStore as simple sorted array of integers, no bitmaps used at all, [1,13,45,100]. However it will not store common prefix, hence saving space. Searches are done through binary search. This sorted array grows dynamically based on heuristics. If number of elements in array container exceeds 4096, then its converted to bitmap container.\n\nBitmap container\n\nStored as 1024 * Word of 64bit , no compression on bitmap. Its fixed size on allocation and does not dynamically grow. It uses 64 bit instructions on processor, hence fast.\n\nRange: [1, 1024]\nBitmap: A 1024-bit long bitmap where each bit represents the presence of a number.\nStored As: Bitmap of 1024 bits, e.g., 000000…1111…00000 (with 1s indicating presence of numbers)\n\n\nRun container\n\nIt is made of a packed array of pairs of 16-bit integers. The first value of each pair represents a starting value, whereas the second value is the length of a run\n\nIntegers: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\nStored As: (11, 4) (start value 11 and length 4 indicating the run so we can increament +1 4 times for each)\n\nSince 2¹⁶ integers are stored in containers, when index operations are performed, it only need to do against 2 containers at a time. Hence never running out of space.\nAuto Batching\nAuto-batching is a feature that will batch together consecutive document additions and perform them together to improve indexing speed. For document addition to being added to the same batch, they need to:\n\ntarget the same index\nhave the same update method (POST /documents or PUT /documents, i.e update or replace documents)\nbe immediately consecutive\n\nAuto-batching can be enabled by passing the --enable-auto-batching flag to MeiliSearch. This, in turn, gives you access to three new parameters:\n\n--max-batch-size &lt;NUM&gt;: set the maximum number of tasks that can be processed in a batch to NUM. This is set to 1 if NUM is 0, since such a value would prevent any task from ever being processed. If not specified, this is unlimited.\n--max-documents-per-batch &lt;NUM&gt;: Set a limit to the maximum number of documents that can be indexed together in a single batch.

It’s responsible for scheduling, prioritizing, and executing tasks such as adding, deleting, or updating documents, as well as managing index metadata.\nTask Scheduler Struct\nThe TaskScheduler struct is a singleton that manages the scheduling of tasks. It has several methods:\n\nregister: registers a new task with the scheduler\nget_next_batch: returns the next batch of tasks to be executed\nabort_processing_tasks: aborts the current task being processed if it’s in the list of tasks to be aborted\nscheduler_worker: a worker function that runs in a separate thread and executes the tasks in the scheduler\n\nTask Types\nThere are several types of tasks that can be scheduled:\n\nDumpImport: imports data from a file\nDumpExport: exports data to a file\nDocumentAddition: adds a new document to the index\nDocumentDeletion: deletes a document from the index\nClearAllDocuments: clears all documents from the index\nSettings: updates the settings of an index\nRenameIndex: renames an index\nCreateIndex: creates a new index\nDeleteIndex: deletes an index\nSwapIndex: swaps two indexes\nCancelTask: cancels a task\n\nInternal Task\nAn InternalTask is a representation of a task that’s stored in the database. It contains additional metadata such as the task’s status, enqueued time, processed time, and error messages.\nTask View\nA TaskView is a representation of a task that’s returned to the user. It contains a subset of the information in the InternalTask, such as the task ID, status, enqueued time, and processed time.\nIndex Task Store\nThe IndexTaskStore is a database that stores information about tasks and indexes. It has several databases:\n\nall_tasks: stores all tasks\nenqueued_tasks: stores tasks that are currently enqueued\nfinished_tasks: stores tasks that have been completed\nindex_name_mapper: maps index names to index UUIDs\nindex_tasks: stores tasks associated with each index\n\nPrioritizer and Auto-Batcher\nThe prioritizer and auto-batcher is a system that determines which tasks to execute next. It takes into account the task type, priority, and dependencies between tasks. It returns a BatchOperation that contains the tasks to be executed.\nBatch Operation\nA BatchOperation is a representation of a batch of tasks to be executed. It can contain multiple tasks, and each task can have additional metadata such as content files or document IDs.\nIndex Access\nThe IndexScheduler struct is responsible for managing access to indexes. It uses a RwLock to protect a HashMap that maps IndexUuid to Index objects. The index method allows retrieving an Index object by its name, and the swap_indexes method swaps the names of two indexes.\nTask Prioritization\nThe system uses two types of prioritizers: a global one and an index-level one. The global prioritizer retrieves important tasks to do first, such as cancel tasks and dumps. The index-level prioritizer manages tasks for a single index and auto-batches them. Task cancelation is processed one by one in reverse order of enqueuing, ensuring a correct and logical way of processing cancelation.\nPrioritized Task Types\nThere are two enums: PrioritizedTaskType and IndexTaskType. PrioritizedTaskType represents global operations, while IndexTaskType represents index-level operations.\nGlobal Prioritizer\nThe global_prioritizer function takes a list of tasks with their types and returns a BatchOperation that the scheduler must process.\nIndex Prioritizer and Auto-Batcher\nThe index_prioritizer_auto_batcher function takes a list of tasks with their types and tries to auto-batch tasks to speed up processing.\nCron Tasks\nThe system plans to implement a mechanism to remove old tasks by creating a loop in a thread that enqueues a new CleanOldTasks task into the task queue. This task will be processed by the scheduler, and users can also request clearing the queue.\nThis is the definition of the IndexScheduler struct in Rust. It’s a complex struct with many fields, which I’ll break down into categories:\nDatabases\n\nenv: an LMDB environment\nall_tasks: a database of all tasks, keyed by their IDs\nstatus: a database of task IDs grouped by their status\nkind: a database of task IDs grouped by their kind\nindex_tasks: a database of tasks associated with an index\ncanceled_by: a database of tasks canceled by a task UID\nenqueued_at, started_at, finished_at: databases of task IDs grouped by their enqueue, start, and finish dates\n\nTask Management\n\nmust_stop_processing: a boolean to stop processing tasks\nprocessing_tasks: a list of tasks currently being processed\nfile_store: a store of files referenced by tasks\n\nIndex Management\n\nindex_mapper: an IndexMapper responsible for creating, opening, storing, and returning indexes\n\nFeatures and Configuration\n\nfeatures: a FeatureData instance for managing experimental features\nautobatching_enabled, cleanup_enabled: booleans for auto-batching and cleanup\nmax_number_of_tasks, max_number_of_batched_tasks: configuration for task limits\nwebhook_url, webhook_authorization_header: webhook configuration\ndumps_path, snapshots_path, auth_path, version_file_path: paths for dumps, snapshots, auth, and version files\n"},"notes/2024/Memory-profiling-Nodejs":{"title":"Memory profiling Nodejs","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A core dump is generated when a Node.js process encounters a critical error that it cannot recover from, such as segmentation faults, accessing invalid memory, or other fatal errors.\n\nBy default, Node.js does not generate core dumps automatically.

To evaluate the efficiency of query plans, the query planner runs all candidate plans during a trial period. In general, the winning plan is the query plan that produces the most results during the trial period while performing the least amount of work.\nThe associated plan cache entry is used for subsequent queries with the same query shape.\nHow is query plan selected?\nMongoDB has empirical query planner - trial period where each candidate plan is executed over short period of time. Planner evaluates which performs the best:\nQuery Shape\nTo help identify slow queries with the same query shape, each query shape is associated with a queryHash. The queryHash is a hexadecimal string that represents a hash of the query shape and is dependent only on the query shape.\nTo get the  information on the plan cache entries for the collection\nplanCacheKey is a hash of the key for the plan cache entry associated with the query.\n\ndb.collection.getPlanCache().clear()\n\ndb.collection.getPlanCache().listQueryShapes()\n\ndb.orders.aggregate( [\n   { $planCacheStats: { } }\n] )\n\n\nWiredTiger stores documents with the snappy compression algorithm by default. Any data read from the file system cache is first decompressed before storing in the WiredTiger cache\n\nTo just get the quer plan but not want to excute the query use below cmd\ndb.collectionName.explain(&quot;queryPlanner&quot;)\nOver time, collection and indexes may change, therefore plan cache will evict the cache occasionally. Plans can be evicted when:\n\nServer restarted.\nAmount of work performed by first portion of query exceeds amount of work performed by winning plan by factor of 10.\nIndex rebuilt.\nIndex created or dropped.\n\nCovered index perf tips\nAdd projection to query such that only index fields are included:\ndb.restaurants.createIndex({name: 1, cuisine: 1, stars: 1})\n \ndb.restaurants.find({name: { $gt: &#039;L&#039; }, cuisine: &#039;Sushi&#039;, stars: { $gte: 4.0 } }, { _id: 0, name: 1, cuisine: 1, stars: 1 })\nThen all data to be returned exists in keys of index. Mongo can match query conditions AND return results only using index.\nCreating above index and running query in shell, executionStats show totalDocsExamined: 0.\nCaveat, if run the same query but modify projection to omit fields that are not index (as opposed to explicitly asking for fields that are in index):\ndb.restaurants.find({name: { $gt: &#039;L&#039; }, cuisine: &#039;Sushi&#039;, stars: { $gte: 4.0 } }, { _id: 0, address: 0 })\nexecutionStats shows totalDocsExamined: 2870, even though query is the same as before. Query planner does not know what other fields might be present, might have some docs with fields that are not covered by index, therefore it needs to examine the documents.\nRegex Performance\nPerformance can be improved by creating index: db.users.createIndex({username: 1}). Now only need to check regex against username index key instead of entire document.\nHowever, still need to look at every single key of index, defeats purpose of index. Recall index stored as B-tree to reduce search space to ordered subset of entire collection.\nTo take advantage of index when using regex, add ^ at beginning of regex to indicate - only want to return docs where the following chars start at beginning of string.\ndb.users.find({username: /^kirby/})\nIndex files use prefix compression\n- use         0 ⇒ use\n- used        1 ⇒ 0d\n- useful      2 ⇒ 0ful\n- usefully    3 ⇒ 2ly\n- usefulness  4 ⇒ 2ness\n- useless     5 ⇒ 0less\n- uselessness 6 ⇒ 5ness\nQuestions to ask before creating indexing\n\nCardinatlity\nhow frequent the field get updated?\nAnother exception is when have indexes on fields that grow monotonically - eg: counters, dates, incremental id’s.

Journal file acts as safeguard against data corruption caused by incopmlete file writes. eg: if system sufferes unexpected shutdown, data stored in journal is used to recover to a consistent and correct state.\nls /data/db/journal\nWiredTigerLog.0000000001      WiredTigerPreplog.0000000002\nWiredTigerPreplog.0000000001\nJournal file structure includes individual write operations. To minimize performance impact of journalling, flushes performed with group commits in compressed format. Writes to journal are atomic to ensure consistency of journal files.\nCache Overflow and the LookAside Table\nWhen WiredTiger’s cache becomes full (cache pressure gets too high), it needs to free up space by evicting pages from the cache. However, if there are updates to those pages that haven’t yet been written to disk, WiredTiger uses the LookAside (LAS) table to store these updates temporarily. This process ensures that the cache can continue operating efficiently without losing any updates.\n\nCache Pressure:\n\nWhen the cache usage approaches its limit, WiredTiger needs to make room for new data by evicting some existing pages.\n\n\nUsing the LookAside Table:\n\nIf a page in the cache has been updated but can’t be immediately written to disk (due to cache overflow), the updates are instead written to the LAS table (WiredTigerLAS.wt).\nThis LAS table serves as an overflow area to temporarily store updates.\n\n\nPage Eviction:\n\nThe updated page is then evicted from the cache.\nA pointer is added in memory indicating that this page has updates stored in the LAS table.\n\n\nReading from LAS:\n\nIf the page needs to be read again, WiredTiger will check the pointer and realize that it needs to fetch updates from the LAS table.\nWhen this happens, the entire history of updates stored in the LAS table for that page is loaded back into memory.\nThis operation is “all or nothing”—the entire update history for the page is loaded, not just a portion of it.\n\n\n\ndb.serverStatus({tcmalloc:true})`\ntcmalloc stands for Thread-Caching Malloc, which is a memory allocation library developed by Google. It’s a drop-in replacement for the standard C malloc function and is designed to be highly efficient and scalable.\nIn the context of MongoDB, tcmalloc is used to manage memory allocation for the WiredTiger storage engine. When you run the command db.serverStatus({tcmalloc:true}), you’re asking MongoDB to return statistics about the memory allocation and usage of the tcmalloc library.\nThe output will include information such as:\n\ngeneric: general memory allocation statistics\ntcmalloc: specific statistics about the tcmalloc library\npageheap_free_bytes: the number of free bytes in the page heap\npageheap_unmapped_bytes: the number of unmapped bytes in the page heap\nmax_total_thread_cache_bytes: the maximum total thread cache bytes\ncurrent_total_thread_cache_bytes: the current total thread cache bytes\ntotal_free_bytes: the total number of free bytes\ncentral_cache_free_bytes: the number of free bytes in the central cache\ntransfer_cache_free_bytes: the number of free bytes in the transfer cache\nthread_cache_free_bytes: the number of free bytes in the thread cache\n\nAdmin cmd\n\ndb.adminCommand({buildInfo:true})\ndb.adminCommand({hostInfo:true})\n\n\n\nLogs\ndb.adminCommand({getLog:&#039;global&#039;})Gets last 1024 entries (global :Combined output of all recent entries )\nProfiling\nThe MongoDB profiler is a useful tool for troubleshooting and optimizing database performance. When enabled, it records operations in the system.profile collection, which can help identify slow queries, inefficient indexing, and other performance bottlenecks.\nenabling the profiler comes with a performance cost. It can cause:\n\nTwice the writes: Each operation is written to the system.profile collection, in addition to the original write operation.\nOne write and one read for slow operations: When a slow operation is detected, the profiler writes the operation to the system.profile collection and also reads the operation from the collection to analyze it.\n\nNote :  MongoDB 4.4 and newer versions provide an alternative to the profiler: logs. You can use logs to capture slow operations and other performance-related data without incurring the additional write and read overhead associated with the profiler\nMongoDB authentication mechanisms\nAvailable in all versions\n\n\nSCRAM(Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism): Default authentication mechanism.\n\nHere MongoDB provides some challenge that user must respond to.\nEquivalent to Password Authentication\nClient requests a unique value (Nonce) from server\nServer sends nonce back\nClient hashes password, adds nonce and hashes hashed password+nonce again\nServer has hashed password saved\nUpon receiving end, server picks hashed password and hashes it + nonce it has sent to client.\nIf both the hashes are equal, the login is successful.\n\n\n\nX.509: Uses X.509 certificate for authentication.\n\n\nAvailable in enterprise versions\n\nLDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocall): Basis of Microsoft AD.\n\nLDAP is sending plaintext data by default, TLS is required to make it secure.\n\n\nKERBEROS: Powerful authentication designed by MIT.\n\nLike x509 certificates but they are very short lived.\n\n\n\nAvailable only in Atlas\n\nMONGODB-AWS: Authenticate using AWS IAM roles.\n\nIntra-cluster Authentication\n\nTwo nodes in a cluster authenticate themselves to a Replica Set. They can either use SCRAM-SHA-1 by generating Key file and sharing key file between the nodes, (the approach used in replication labs).\n\nIf they use this key file mechanism user will be __system@local and password will be generated keyfile\n\n\nOr they can authenticate using X.509 certificates which are issued by same authority and can be separated from each other.\n\nAuthorization\n\nRBAC is implemented\n\nEach user has one or more roles\nEach role has one or more privileges\nEach privilege represents a group of actions and the resources where those actions are applied\nE.g. There are three roles, Admin, Developer and Performance Inspector\nAdmin has all the privileges.\nDeveloper can create, update collection, indices and data. They can also delete indices and data. But can not change any performance tuning parameter.\nPerformance Inspector can view all the data and indices, can see and change performance tuning parameter.\n\n\n\nResources\ngithub.com/danielabar/mongo-performance [ need to read from Performance on Clusters]\ntech.oyorooms.com/mongodb-out-of-memory-kill-process-mongodb-using-too-much-memory-solved-44e9ae577bed\nfor(let i=0;i&lt;100;i++){\n      const largeObject = {\n            name: &#039;Test Object&#039;,\n            nested: {},\n            array: []\n        };\n\n        for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {\n            largeObject.nested[`property${i}`] = &#039;x&#039;.repeat(1000); // 1000 characters string\n        }\n\n       \n        for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {\n            largeObject.array.push({ index: i, value: &#039;y&#039;.repeat(1000) }); // 1000 characters string\n        }\n\n  \n        const docs = Array(100).fill(largeObject);\n   \n    db.questions.insertMany(docs)\n    }\n\nTo get DataSize\nThis returns a document with the size in bytes for all matching documents mentioned in keypattern on collection mentioned in dataSize\ndb.runCommand({ \n\tdataSize: &quot;database.collection&quot;,  //database -&gt; databaseName\n\tkeyPattern: { field: 1 },\n\t min: { field: 10 }, \n\t max: { field: 100 } }\n\t)\nVertical sharding\n\nsplit by table\n\nHorzontal sharding\n\nsplit by collection level\nmongos\nconfig server\nshards\n\nIdea\n\nTry to convert index.wt file and print as json\n\nSRV\nSRV (Service) record is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) record that specifies the location of a server or service.\nSRV Record Format:\nAn SRV record provides information about the hostnames and ports where the MongoDB instances are running.

It starts with a base vocabulary of individual characters and then iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of tokens into new tokens.\n\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE)\n\nUsed by: GPT-2, RoBERTa\nDescription: BPE is similar to WordPiece but focuses on merging the most frequent pairs of bytes in the text, creating a hierarchical representation of text where frequent subword units are represented as single tokens.\n\nUnigram Language Model\n\nUsed by: SentencePiece, XLNet\nDescription: The Unigram model starts with a large vocabulary of potential subwords and iteratively removes the subwords that are least likely to be beneficial, aiming to maximize the likelihood of the given text under the subword distribution.\n\nSentencePiece\n\nUsed by: T5, MarianMT\nDescription: SentencePiece is a subword tokenizer that can use either BPE or Unigram Language Model techniques. It treats the input text as a sequence of Unicode characters and constructs the vocabulary from these, without requiring any pre-tokenization.\n\nSentencePieceBPETokenizer\n\nUsed by: Hugging Face’s tokenizers library\nDescription: This is a hybrid approach provided by the tokenizers library from Hugging Face.

This binary format is more compact and efficient\n\n\nServer Push: HTTP/2 supports server push, which allows the server to send additional resources (like images, stylesheets, or scripts) to the client before the client requests them.\n\n\nStream Prioritization: Allows the client to indicate the priority of each resource.\n\n\nConnection Multiplexing: HTTP/2 uses a single, multiplexed connection per origin.\n\n\n HTTP/2 frames that have type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID) and payload. The stream ID makes it clear which bytes on the wire apply to which message, allowing safe multiplexing and concurrency. Streams are bidirectional. Clients send frames and servers reply with frames using the same ID.\n \nClient requests always use odd-numbered stream IDs, so subsequent requests would use stream IDs 3, 5, and so on. Responses can be served in any order, and frames from different streams can be interleaved.\nA server that is unable to establish a new stream identifier can send a GOAWAY frame so that the client is forced to open a new connection for new streams\nFormat\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                 Frame Header                  |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                 Frame Payload                 |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\nFrame Header: Represents the common structure at the beginning of each frame. It includes fields such as:\n\n\nLength: The length of the frame payload.\n\n\nType: The type of the frame (e.g., HEADERS, DATA, SETTINGS, etc.).\n\nHEADERS Frame (Type 0x1):\n\nCarries header fields for a particular stream.\nCan be used for request or response headers.\n\n\nPRIORITY Frame (Type 0x2):\n\nIndicates the sender’s priority weighting for a stream.\nHelps in managing the order of processing streams.\n\n\nRST_STREAM Frame (Type 0x3):\n\nIndicates that a stream is being terminated or reset.\nIncludes an error code indicating the reason for termination.\nthis will send when we navigate to another page browser will send to free up resources in server that no need anymore\n\n\nSETTINGS Frame (Type 0x4):\n\nUsed to communicate configuration settings for both the client and server.\nParameters include initial window size, maximum frame size, etc.\n\n\nPUSH_PROMISE Frame (Type 0x5):\n\nSent by the server to initiate a server push.\nSpecifies a promised request and the associated stream identifier.\n\n\nPING Frame (Type 0x6):\n\nUsed to measure a round-trip time between endpoints.\nPrimarily used as a keep-alive mechanism.\n\n\nGOAWAY Frame (Type 0x7):\n\nSent by a server to indicate that further communication should not occur on a given connection.\nIncludes information about the last stream ID processed.\n\n\nWINDOW_UPDATE Frame (Type 0x8):\n\nUsed to adjust the size of the flow-control window.\nCan be sent by both the client and the server.\n\n\nCONTINUATION Frame (Type 0x9):\n\nUsed to continue a sequence of header block fragments.\nAllows header information to be spread across multiple frames.\n\n\nDATA Frame (Type 0x0):\n\nUsed to carry the payload of an HTTP message, such as the content of a request or response body.\nIt can be associated with a specific stream.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlags: Flags providing additional information about the frame.\n\nEND_STREAM (0x1):\n\nIndicates that the frame represents the end of a stream.\nApplies to HEADERS, DATA, and CONTINUATION frames.\n\n\nEND_HEADERS (0x4):\n\nIndicates that this frame contains the final chunk of a header set.\nApplies to HEADERS, CONTINUATION, and PUSH_PROMISE frames.\n\n\nPADDED (0x8):\n\nIndicates that the frame is followed by padding.\nThe length of the padding is determined by the value of the Pad Length field in the frame.\n\n\nPRIORITY (0x20):\n\nIndicates that the frame includes stream priority information.\nApplies to HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE, and CONTINUATION frames.\n\n\nACK (0x1):\n\nIndicates that the SETTINGS frame acknowledges the receipt and application of the peer’s settings.\nApplies to SETTINGS frames.\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Identifier: Identifies the stream to which the frame belongs.\n\n\nFrame Payload: Represents the specific content of the frame, which varies based on the frame type. For example:\n\nFor a HEADERS frame, the payload includes header information.\nFor a DATA frame, the payload includes the actual data being sent.\n\nRapid resets leading to denial of service\nThe challenge occurs when a client rapidly cancels many requests in an HTTP/2 environment, and the server or intermediary (like a proxy) struggles to promptly handle these cancellations. This can result in a buildup of tasks, causing resource consumption issues, especially in scenarios where there’s a delay in cleaning up in-process jobs.\nrefere here\nHTTP3\nIt uses QUIC in transport layer\nSecurity Header in HTTP\n\nContent-Security-Policy (CSP):\n\nDefines a policy to control resource loading, mitigating risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src &#039;self&#039;; specifies that content such as scripts, stylesheets, and images should be loaded only from the same origin.\nExample : let assume some how hacker inject the script tag to our website but if we have the CSP it will not be loaded by browser becasue we mentioned load only from self origin\n\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:\n\nSpecifies which origins are permitted to access the resource\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: www.example.com  this will inform the browser that only example.com can be allow to access using fetch or any API interface methods\nSimilar to this there some other header presents like Access-Control-Allow-Methods , Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials etc..\n\n\nStrict-Transport-Security (HSTS):\n\nForces secure connections (HTTPS) by instructing browsers to interact with the website only over secure connections.\n\n\nX-Content-Type-Options:\n\nPrevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type, reducing the risk of certain attacks.\n\n\nX-Frame-Options:\n\nControls whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a frame, mitigating clickjacking attacks.\nX-Frame-Options: DENY This tell the browser that this website is not allowed to inject in iframe\nSAMEORIGIN This tell the browser allow iframe in the same origin\n\n\nX-XSS-Protection:\n\nEnables or disables the browser’s built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection.\n\n\nSameSite\n\n&#039;strict&#039; make sure the cookie will be send only the respective origin that set the cookie\n\n\n\nHTTPS\nis a secure version of HTTP.\nHow the HTTPS connection flow\n\n\nThe browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the web server’s IP address on port 443, which is the default port for HTTPS.\n\n\nThe browser initiates the SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) handshake process by sending a ClientHello message to the server.\n\n\nThe web server responds with its SSL/TLS certificate, which includes the server’s public key, the server’s identity, and the digital signature of a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).\n\n\nThe browser verifies the authenticity of the server’s certificate. It checks if the certificate is signed by a trusted CA, is not expired, and matches the domain in the URL.\n\n\nThe browser generates a symmetric session key, encrypts it with the server’s public key, and sends it back to the server. This session key will be used for encrypting and decrypting data during the session.\n\n\nThe server sends a Finished message to signal that the initial handshake is complete.\n\n\nThe browser sends its own Finished message, confirming the completion of the handshake.\n\n\nSSL flow\n\nThe client sends a ClientHello message to which the server must respond with a ServerHello message, or else a fatal error will occur and the connection will fail.  The ClientHello and ServerHello are used to establish security enhancement capabilities between client and server.\nThe ClientHello and ServerHello establish the following attributes: Protocol Version, Session ID, Cipher Suite, and Compression Method.  Additionally, two random values are generated and exchanged: ClientHello.random and ServerHello.random.\nFollowing the hello messages, the server will send its certificate in a Certificate message if it is to be authenticated.\nClient vaildate the certificate and use the server public key to encyrpt the content such as session key and initiate the session\nNote : session key (which is symmentric key used to decrypt and encrypt the msg after TLS handshake done. symmentric is used because it is faster then asymmentric)\nAfter server recevie the session key and it ack .\n\n\nResource\n\nwww.linuxbabe.com/security/ssltls-handshake-process-explained-with-wireshark-screenshot\n\nSever private key vs SSL session Key\nServer Private Key:\n- Purpose: The server’s private key is a crucial component in the SSL/TLS handshake process. It is used for asymmetric encryption and decryption during the initial phase of establishing a secure connection.\n- Usage: The server’s private key is used by the server to decrypt the symmetric session key sent by the client during the handshake. It is kept confidential and is used for securing the key exchange process.\n- Lifetime: The server’s private key has a long lifespan and is associated with the SSL/TLS certificate, often valid for a year or more.\nSSL/TLS Session Keys:\n- Purpose: Session keys are symmetric encryption keys that are generated uniquely for each SSL/TLS session. They are used for encrypting and decrypting the actual data being transmitted between the client and the server.\n- Usage: Once the initial handshake is complete and the symmetric session key is agreed upon during the key exchange phase, the subsequent data transfer uses symmetric encryption. This is more efficient than asymmetric encryption and provides confidentiality for the transmitted data.\n- Lifetime: Session keys are short-lived and are typically used for the duration of a single session. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) mechanisms ensure that even if the server’s private key is compromised in the future, previously captured encrypted sessions cannot be decrypted.\nWhat is Server Certificate\nThe server sends its digital certificate to the client. The certificate contains:\n\nPublic Key: Used for encrypting the session key.\nServer’s Identity (Common Name): The domain name for which the certificate was issued.\nIssuer: The CA that issued the certificate.\nDigital Signature: A signature by the CA, confirming the authenticity of the certificate.\n\nWho is CA\nA Certificate Authority is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates.The process involves the following steps:\n\n\nCertificate Request: A website owner generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) containing their public key and other identification information. The CSR is a file containing essential information about the website and its public key.\n\nopenssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private-key.pem will  generate a public-private key pair\nopenssl req -new -key private-key.pem -out mysite.csr With the private key create a CSR\nNote : LetsEncrypt scripts use OpenSSL to generate certificates and sign them with the LetsEncrypt service.\n\n\n\nCSR Submission: The website owner submits the CSR to a CA.\n\n\nVerification: The CA verifies the identity of the entity requesting the certificate. it check does we really owing the domain. they give the file that we need to serve on our domain they check does the file is serving on our domain.\n\n\nCertificate Issuance: Upon successful verification, the CA issues a digital certificate, signing it with the CA’s private key.\n\n\nDistribution to the Website:  The CA sends the issued certificate to the website owner.\n\n\nWhat is SSL/TLS?\nSSL/TLS relies on public-key cryptography for secure key exchange and data encryption.it has two key public and private key public to encrypt and private to decrypt the data.\nNote: TLS is considered the more secure and modern protocol.\nSMTP\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol used in the Internet to transfer electronic mail (email).\n\t              +----------+                +----------+\n      +------+    |          |                |          |\n      | User |&lt;--&gt;|          |      SMTP      |          |\n      +------+    |  Client- |Commands/Replies| Server-  |\n      +------+    |   SMTP   |&lt;--------------&gt;|    SMTP  |    +------+\n      | File |&lt;--&gt;|          |    and Mail    |          |&lt;--&gt;| File |\n      |System|    |          |                |          |    |System|\n      +------+    +----------+                +----------+    +------+\n                   SMTP client                SMTP server\n\nWhen an SMTP client has a message to transmit, it establishes a two-way transmission channel to an SMTP server.  The responsibility of an SMTP client is to transfer mail messages to one or more SMTP servers, or report its failure to do so.\nAn SMTP client determines the address of an appropriate host running an SMTP server by resolving a destination domain name to either an intermediate Mail eXchanger host or a final target host.\nThe SMTP Procedures: An Overview\nAn SMTP session is initiated when a client opens a connection to a server and the server responds with an opening message.\nOnce the server has sent the greeting (welcoming) message and the client has received it, the client normally sends the EHLO command to the server, indicating the client’s identity.\nThere are 3 steps to SMTP mail transactions.\n\nThe transaction starts with a MAIL command that gives the sender identification.  MAIL FROM:&lt;reverse-path&gt; [SP &lt;mail-parameters&gt; ] &lt;CRLF&gt; . This command tells the SMTP-receiver that a new mail transaction is starting and to reset all its state tables and buffers\nThe second step in the procedure is the RCPT command.   RCPT TO:&lt;forward-path&gt; [ SP &lt;rcpt-parameters&gt; ] &lt;CRLF&gt;  The first or only argument to this command includes a forward-path identifying one recipient.  If accepted, the SMTP server returns a “250 OK” reply and stores the forward-path.\nThe third step in the procedure is the DATA command DATA &lt;CRLF&gt;  If SMTP accepted, the SMTP server returns a “250 OK” reply\n\nHow Mail Routed to the destination\nSMTP will do DNS query to lookup for the Mail eXchanger (MX) records for the sender domain. MX records hold the IP for the mail servers that are designated to handle incoming emails for the domain.The MX records include priority values, indicating the order in which mail servers should be used. Lower values represent higher priority.\nPOP / IMAP\nPOP (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) are two different protocols used for retrieving emails from a mail server to a local email client.\nPOP(Post Offic Protocol): Establish connection with SMTP server and send greeting once it accepted.client server exchange the mail.it downloads emails from the server to the local device.emails are removed from the server after being downloaded.\nIMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders. IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.\nDNS\nDomain name system used to translate the domain to IP. It uses UDP protocol on port 57.\nFirst browser check does the domain corresponding IP in local cache if so use if not do the DNS Query.\nHow DNS Query get resolved\n\nThe resolver queries recursive DNS servers, which are typically provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a third-party service like Google’s. These servers either have the IP address for the requested domain in their cache or initiate further queries to find it.\nIf the recursive DNS servers don’t have the information, they query root DNS servers.\nThere are 13 sets of root DNS servers worldwide (labeled A to M), and they provide information about Top-Level Domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, .net, etc.\nThe Root DNS servers direct the query to the authoritative DNS servers for the specific Top-Level Domain (TLD) of the requested domain.\nThe TLD DNS servers provide information about the authoritative DNS servers for the second-level domain (e.g., “example.com”).\nThe authoritative DNS servers or Name Server (mostly our domain provider) respond to the query with the IP address associated with the requested domain.\n\nRecords in DNS\n\nA (Address) Record: Associates a domain name with an IPv4 address.\nAAAA (IPv6 Address) Record: domain name with an IPv6 address\nCNAME (Canonical Name) Record: alias for a domain name, pointing it to another domain’s canonical (official) name  this can be used if you want a example.com domain to google.com we can add the CName record for it.\nMX (Mail Exchange) Record: mail servers responsible for receiving emails on behalf of the domain.\nTXT (Text) Record: text information associated with a domain. Often used for DNS-based verification or providing additional information.\nNS (Name Server) Record: Specifies authoritative DNS servers for the domain\nSender policy framework (SPF) record: that lists all the servers authorized to send emails from a particular domain. when the recevier recevie mail from this domain it will check for the SPK record in sender domain address if the IP is in that list it will allow else block it or mark as spam.\n\nNote: The DNS first Query for the A Record if it exist it use the IP else it look for the CName for the domain which will have a another domain which have A Record that will hold the IP of the server\nDHCP\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol is used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network.\nHow Client Communicate with DHCP\n\n\nThe client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message on its local physical subnet.\n\n\nEach server may respond with a DHCPOFFER message that includes an available network address\n\n\nThe client receives one or more DHCPOFFER messages from one or more servers.  The client may choose to wait for multiple responses. The client chooses one server from which to request configuration parameters, based on the configuration parameters offered in the DHCPOFFER messages.\n\n\nThe client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST message that MUST include the ‘server identifier’ option to indicate which server it has selected\n\n\nThe server selected in the DHCPREQUEST message commits the binding for the client to persistent storage and responds with a DHCPACK message containing the configuration parameters are default gateway IP, subnetmask,DNS server address,least time (time for IP valid)\n\n\nSSH\nProvides secure access to a remote device or server over a network, allowing for encrypted communication and command execution.\nWebRTC\nPeer to peer exchange video and audio\nSTUN (session traversal util for NAT)\n\nA Server tell me my public ip address/port through NAT\nThe client want to know his public ip and port (the ip of router)\nThe clent will do STUN request to the STUN server where it send the response of the public ip and port\n\nTURN (traversal using relay around NAT)\nVoIP\nallows voice communication and multimedia sessions over the Internet.\nVoIP devices register with a VoIP server using a protocol like SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). SIP is responsible for establishing, modifying, and terminating real-time sessions.\nTo connect with traditional phone networks, VoIP calls often go through an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP). The ITSP serves as a gateway between the IP-based and traditional telephone networks.\nprotocols commonly used in VoIP\n\nSIP (Session Initiation Protocol):\n\nSIP is a signaling protocol used for initiating, modifying, and terminating communication sessions. It’s widely used for setting up and tearing down VoIP calls.\n\n\nRTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol):\n\nRTP is used for transmitting audio and video data in real-time over the internet. It works in conjunction with RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol) for quality monitoring.\n\n\nSDP (Session Description Protocol):\n\nSDP is used to describe multimedia sessions for the purpose of session announcement, invitation, and other forms of initiation.\n\n\nRTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol):\n\nRTCP works alongside RTP to provide control information during a VoIP session, including statistics on packet loss, jitter, and round-trip delay.\n\n\nUDP (User Datagram Protocol):\n\nUDP is a transport protocol commonly used for carrying voice packets in VoIP due to its low-latency characteristics. It’s also used for SIP signaling.\n\n\nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol):\n\nWhile less common for voice transmission due to its connection-oriented nature, TCP is used in certain scenarios for SIP signaling and situations where retransmission of lost packets is preferred over real-time delivery.\n\n\nTLS (Transport Layer Security):\n\nTLS is used to secure the signaling (SIP) and media streams in VoIP, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of communications.\n\n\nSTUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT):\n\nSTUN is used to discover the presence of network address translators (NATs) and to obtain the public IP address and port of a VoIP client.\n\n\nTURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT):\n\nTURN is used to relay media when direct peer-to-peer communication is not possible due to NAT or firewall traversal issues.\n\n\nICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment):\n\nICE is a framework that leverages STUN and TURN to facilitate the establishment of peer-to-peer connections in the presence of NAT and firewalls.\n\n\nMGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol):\n\nMGCP is a protocol used for controlling media gateways in VoIP networks, often used in conjunction with the more modern SIP and H.323.\n\n\n\nSIP Proxy Server\nA SIP proxy receives and processes SIP requests from a redirect server or software.\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP)\nSIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish,modify, and terminate multimedia sessions (conferences) such as calls.\nResponses are coded based on their message. Different preceding numbers in a three-digit sequence have different meanings.\nFor example, 1xx response codes mean the device received and is processing the message. Codes starting with 2xx mean completion, 3xx is used for redirections, 4xx is for authentication errors, etc.\nThe most common code is 200, meaning the action was completed successfully without further details.\nA SIP registrar is similar to an address book. It associates the various users with the access points on the IP network where one can reach them.\nMost SIP addresses connect to a unique phone number\n underlying media streams for audio and video calls typically use separate protocols, like RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol), which ensures timely delivery of media data.\nSIP URI\nIt has a similar form to an email address, typically containing a username and a host name.  In this case, it is sip:bob@biloxi.com, where biloxi.com is the domain of Bob’s SIP service provider.\nCodecs\nA codec, which stands for coder-decoder, converts an audio signal into compressed digital form for transmission and then back into an uncompressed audio signal for replay.\nTools\nNslookup\ntool for querying the Domain Name System to obtain the mapping between domain name and IP address,\n\nnslookup mydomain.com → Will print the IP and other DNS details\nnslookup -type=AAAA mydomain.com → will print only AAA record\n\nDomain Information Groper command (DIG)\nfor Making DNS queries dig example.com , dig NS com  will print name server of the domain\nTransport Layer\nIt is responsible for ensuring end-to-end communication and data transfer between applications. In this layer the data is divided into small small segements and also it control the flow of the data transfer ,detecting packet losses (via sequence numbers) and errors (via per-segment checksums), as well as correction via retransmission\nThe two most commonly used transport layer protocols are:\n\nTCP\nUDP\n\nTCP\nTransmission Control Protocol is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable and ordered delivery of data between two devices. It establishes a connection before data transfer, breaks data into segments, manages acknowledgment and retransmission of data, and ensures that data is delivered without errors and in the correct order.\nsockets doors through which data passes from the network to the process and through which data passes from the process to the network.\nTCP use Port no and IP to bind the data to socket when multiple process running on the machine it uses the Port no and IP to bind with socket\nTCP protocol runs only in the end systems and not in the intermediate network elements (routers and link-layer switches), the intermediate network elements do not maintain TCP connection state.\nHow TCP Works\n\n\nIt first perfom 3 way hadshake. The client sends a TCP segment with the **SYN **(synchronize) flag set to the server, indicating an initiation of a connection.\n\n\nThe server responds with a TCP segment containing SYN-ACK, acknowledging the request and indicating its readiness to establish a connection.\n\n\nThe client sends a final TCP segment with an ACK (acknowledge) flag set, confirming the server’s acknowledgment. The connection is now established.\n\n\nTCP Peer A                                              TCP Peer B\n \n1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN\n \n2.

The associated application process will read data from this buffer.\nThe receive window is used to give the sender an idea of how much free buffer space is available at the receiver.\nTCP slow start\n Servers only send a few packets (typically 10) in the initial round-trip while TCP is warming up (referred to as TCP slow start). After sending the first set of packets, it needs to wait for the client to acknowledge it received all those packets. server make sure at air it won’t go above 10 that does not recevie ACK.\n \n The larger the initial window, the more we can transfer in the first roundtrip, the faster your site is on the initial page load. For a large roundtrip time .\nThe only way to estimate the available capacity between the client and the server is to measure it by exchanging data, and this is precisely what slow-start is designed to do. To start, the server initializes a new congestion window (cwnd) variable per TCP connection and sets its initial value to a conservative, system-specified value (initcwnd on Linux).\nCongestion window size (cwnd)\n\nSender-side limit on the amount of data the sender can have in flight before receiving an acknowledgment (ACK) from the client.\n\nThe maximum amount of data in flight for a new TCP connection is the minimum of the rwnd and cwnd values; hence a modern server can send up to ten network segments to the client, at which point it must stop and wait for an acknowledgment.\nThen, for every received ACK, the slow-start algorithm indicates that the server can increment its cwnd window size by one segment — for every ACKed packet, two new packets can be sent. This phase of the TCP connection is commonly known as the “exponential growth” algorithm.\nGoogle introduced a new Algo for this which is called BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time) which make YouTube network throughput by 4 percent on average globally\nTCP Congestion Control\nWhen sender send more at rate but recevier is not able to process the data at same speed the recevier buffer will be full and there is packet loss. To avoid that the recevier send the buffer size to sender i have only this much free space so send the data accordingly\nSACK\nSelective Acknowledgment, is an extension to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) designed to improve the performance of data transmission in networks with packet loss.\nSACK introduces an option in the TCP header that allows the receiver to selectively acknowledge specific segments of data that have been received successfully. This enables the receiver to inform the sender about the non-contiguous blocks of data that have been successfully received.\nSACK is an optional extension in TCP and is negotiated during the connection establishment phase. If both the sender and receiver support SACK, they can use it; otherwise, they fall back to regular TCP behavior.\nUDP\nUser Datagram  Protocol provides  a procedure  for application  programs  to send\nmessages  to other programs  with a minimum  of protocol mechanism.\nThe protocol  is transaction oriented, and delivery and duplicate protection are not guaranteed.\nUDP bind the socket with destination IP and Port\nNo handshaking is required on UDP mostly it used for live streaming data\nFormat\n  \n  0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31\n +--------+--------+--------+--------+\n |     Source      |   Destination   |\n |      Port       |      Port       |\n +--------+--------+--------+--------+\n |                 |                 |\n |     Length      |    Checksum     |\n +--------+--------+--------+--------+\n |\n |          data octets ...\n +---------------- ...---------------+\n\nTools\nNetcat\nused to create TCP or UDP connections.\n\nnc -v hostname or IP address port\nnc -l port : →in listen mode to receive incoming connections.\nnc -l port &gt; output_file: (listen on the port and store the data to file)\nnc ip port &lt; input_file: send the file content to the host on port\n\nTcpdump\nCaptures and analyzes network traffic. this will capture all network on the host we can use that and load to the wireshark to analyze it\n\ntcpdump  host ip → capture only from this host by defaulr all\n\nNmap\nScans and discovers devices on a network, providing information about open ports and services. nmap [hostname or IP address]\nNetworking Layer\nIt is responsible for logical addressing, routing, and forwarding of data between different networks. It enables end-to-end communication by determining the best path for data packets to traverse through interconnected networks.\nIP Address\nAn IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device. IP addresses come in two versions, IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit),\nIP addresses are categorized into classes based on their leading bits\n\nClass A:  Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0 (or /8 in CIDR notation). Range: 1 to 126\nClass B: Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 (or /16 in CIDR notation) 128 to 191\nClass C: Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation) 192 to 223\nClass D (Multicast): for multicast groups. 224 to 239\nClass E (Reserved): for experimental purposes. 240 to 255\n127 → loop back Ip (localhost)\n\nSubnet Mask\nA subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into network and host portions. It is used to specify which part of the IP address represents the network and which part identifies the specific device within that network.\nIt was introduced instead of class to make it easier to find network and host.\n\n192.168.1.1  for this IP the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0\n\n192.168.1.1   -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001(bin)\n255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n\nit means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are dedicated to the network, and the last 8 bits are for host addresses. so we can start from 00000000 to  11111111 (255)\nSo for the IP the network portion is 192.168.1 and host is 1  and we can add 1 to 255 computer (host) in this network\nNote 192.168.1 starting IP is act as router in the network. last IP 192.168.255 is used for broadcasting when we send data to that IP it will be sent all host belong to the network\nCIDR Notation\nCIDR notation represents IP addresses using a format that combines the base IP address and the number of bits used for the network portion. It follows the pattern: IP_address/prefix_length. For example, “192.168.1.0/24” means that the first 24 bits of the address are the network portion and balance 8 bit is host\nData Format (Packet)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 \n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|Ver= 4 |IHL= 5 |Type of Service|        Total Length = 21      |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|      Identification = 111     |Flg=0|   Fragment Offset = 0   |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|   Time = 123  |  Protocol = 1 |        header checksum        |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|                         source address                        |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|                      destination address                      |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|     data      |                                                \n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nTime: This field indicates the maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain in the internet system.The router that route the packet will decrease the Time if it became zero router will drop this helps to avoid packets get loops in router it will drop once it get 0.\n\nIPV6\nIPv6 increases the IP address size from 32 bits to 128 bits\nIPv6 Header Format\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|Version| Traffic Class |           Flow Label                  |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|         Payload Length        |  Next Header  |   Hop Limit   |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|                                                               |\n+                                                               +\n|                                                               |\n+                         Source Address                        +\n|                                                               |\n+                                                               +\n|                                                               |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n|                                                               |\n+                                                               +\n|                                                               |\n+                      Destination Address                      +\n|                                                               |\n+                                                               +\n|                                                               |\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nVersion : 4-bit Internet Protocol version number = 6.\nHop Limit : like TTL in IPV4 (Decremented by 1 by each node that forwards the packet.)\nTraffic Class :\n\nICMP\nRouting Protocol\nRouting protocols determine how your data gets to its destination it mainly classify in two types\n\nInterior Gateway Protocols (IGP)\nExterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)\n\nInterior Gateway Protocols (IGP)\nThese are used within an autonomous system (AS), which is a collection of routers under the same administrative control like our ISP. Examples include Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).\nExterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)\nThese are used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems. example: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\nRouter\nRouter are all over the internet helps to transmit the data from one network to another network.It has routing table which hold the IP of the known router that router and the destination.when ever router route the packet it add his IP and MAC address to the packet\nHost communicate with router using MAC address and use ARP  protocol to find the MAC address of the router.\nNAT\nNetwork Address Translation allows multiple devices within a local network to share a single public IP address for communication with external networks,\nISP uses NAT where some group of users comes under the same Router where it replace his IP when the request going out of internal.\nTypes\n\nOne to one (packet to external IP:port on the router always maps to internal ip:port )\nAddress restricted NAT\nPort restricted\nSymmentric\n\nTools\nTraceroute\ndetermines the route to a destination by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets to the destination. In these packets, TRACERT uses varying IP Time-To-Live (TTL) values. Because each router along the path is required to decrement the packet’s TTL by at least 1 before forwarding the packet, the TTL is effectively a hop counter. When the TTL on a packet reaches zero (0), the router sends an ICMP “Time Exceeded” message back to the source computer.\nTRACERT sends the first echo packet with a TTL of 1 and increments the TTL by 1 on each subsequent transmission, until the destination responds or until the maximum TTL is reached.\n\ntracert domain → will print how the packet is get transfered (the router will display * (asterisk) if no response is received.)\n\nMy traceroute\nthat combines the functionality of traceroute and ping. mtr [destination] will print all router with time it taken\nNetstat\nDisplays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and more.\n\nnetstat -a → Shows all active network connections.\nnetstat -l → list all open ports\nnetstat -r → print routing table\nnetstat -p → process ID (PID) and program name associated with each network socket.\nnetstat -s → summary of various network-related statistics, such as total packets transmitted and received.\n\nData Link Layer\nThis layer is responsible for the framing, addressing, and error detection of data packets.The data link layer is concerned with local delivery of frames between devices on the same LAN\nEthernet\nDefines the rules for how devices on a local area network (LAN) communicate with each other. It is the most common technology for wired LANs and is part of the IEEE 802.3 standard.\nKey features and aspects of Ethernet:\n\nFrame Format:\n\nEthernet uses a frame format for data transmission. A frame consists of various fields, including destination and source MAC addresses, a type field indicating the type of payload, the payload itself, and a Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for error detection.\n\n\nMAC Address:\n\nEthernet uses Media Access Control (MAC) addresses to uniquely identify devices on a network. These addresses are assigned to network interface cards (NICs) and are crucial for addressing and forwarding Ethernet frames.\n\n\nCarrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):\n\nEthernet uses a network access method called CSMA/CD. Devices on an Ethernet network listen for the presence of a carrier (other devices transmitting) before attempting to transmit. If a collision is detected, devices use a backoff algorithm before retransmitting.\n\n\nHub, Switch, and Bridge:\n\nEthernet networks can be extended using devices such as hubs, switches, and bridges.\n\nHub: A basic networking device that broadcasts data to all devices in the network.\nSwitch: A more intelligent device that uses MAC addresses to selectively forward frames only to the device for which the frame is intended.\nBridge: Connects multiple network segments and uses MAC addresses for filtering traffic.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed and Duplex:\n\nEthernet supports different data rates, including 10 Mbps (Ethernet), 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet), 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet), 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, and 100 Gbps. The duplex mode can be half-duplex (communication in one direction at a time) or full-duplex (simultaneous two-way communication).\n\n\nTwisted Pair Cabling:\n\nEthernet commonly uses twisted pair cables for data transmission. Categories of twisted pair cables, such as Cat5e, Cat6, and Cat6a, support different data rates and distances.\n\n\nFiber Optic Cabling:\n\nIn addition to copper cables, Ethernet can operate over fiber optic cables, providing higher bandwidth and longer-distance capabilities.\n\n\nEthernet Frame Types:\n\nEthernet supports various frame types, including Ethernet II, IEEE 802.2, and IEEE 802.3. The most commonly used frame type today is Ethernet II.\n\n\nEthernet over TCP/IP:\n\nEthernet is often used as the underlying technology for TCP/IP networks. It is the foundation for local networking and Internet connectivity.\n\n\n\nMedia Access Control (MAC)\nMAC is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on the physical network. It is a hardware address burned into the network interface card (NIC).\nWe cannot change MAC address mostly but can be using software.MAC are used to communicate with LAN\nMAC is 48 bit. 24 bit  for vendor number and 24 bit will unique for the NIC.\nARP (Address Resolution Protocol)\nARP resolves an IP address to a MAC address.Each host and router has an ARP table in its memory, which contains mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses in there LAN.\nIf the host does not have the mapping it will send ARP packet to all host in his LAN and host will return there MAC.ARP operates when a host wants to send a datagram to another host on the same subnet.\nTools\nARP\nDisplays the current ARP table, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.\n\narp -a\narp -s IP address MAC address →Adds a static entry to the ARP table\n\nPhysical Layer\nResponsible for the physical transmission of raw bits over a physical medium. It deals with the actual hardware connections, transmission media, and electrical or optical signaling.\nRFC\nRFC stands for “Request for Comments.” It is a series of documents and notes about the specifications, protocols, procedures, and conventions related to the operation and development of the internet. The RFC series is maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a large open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution and smooth operation of the Internet architecture.\nThe RFC documents cover a wide range of topics, including protocols, procedures, programs, and meeting notes.

If its value does not match any server name, or the request does not contain this header field at all, then nginx will route the request to the default server for this port.\nReloading server with zero down time\nUpdating NGINX configuration is a very simple, lightweight, and reliable operation. It typically just means running the nginx -s reload command, which checks the configuration on disk and sends the master process a SIGHUP signal.\nWhen the master process receives a SIGHUP, it does two things:\n\nReloads the configuration and forks a new set of worker processes. These new worker processes immediately begin accepting connections and processing traffic (using the new configuration settings).\nSignals the old worker processes to gracefully exit. The worker processes stop accepting new connections. As soon as each current HTTP request completes, the worker process cleanly shuts down the connection (that is, there are no lingering keepalives). Once all connections are closed, the worker processes exit.\n\nThis reload process can cause a small spike in CPU and memory usage, but it’s generally imperceptible compared to the resource load from active connections\nLogs\naccesslog\nhave all api logs what are the requset came .\nhttp {\n    ...\n    log_format main &#039;$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] &quot;$request&quot; &#039;\n                      &#039;$status $body_bytes_sent &quot;$http_referer&quot; &#039;\n                      &#039;&quot;$http_user_agent&quot; &quot;$http_x_forwarded_for&quot;&#039;;\n    \n    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;\n    ...\n}\n\nError Logs\nhttp {\n    ...\n    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;\n    ...\n}\n\n\nCaching\nWhen nginx reads the response from an upstream server, the content is first written to a temporary file outside of the cache directory structure. When nginx finishes processing the request it renames the temporary file and moves it to the cache directory. If the temporary files directory for proxying is on another file system, the file will be copied, thus it’s recommended to keep both temporary and cache directories on the same file system. It is also quite safe to delete files from the cache directory structure when they need to be explicitly purged. There are third-party extensions for nginx which make it possible to control cached content remotely, and more work is planned to integrate this functionality in the main distribution.\nThe ngx_http_limit_conn_module module is used to limit the number of connections per the defined key, in particular, the number of connections from a single IP address.\nhttp {\n\tproxy_cache_path /path  (physical loation to live)\n\tmax_size=300g inactive=12\n\tproxy_cache_key $scheme$proxy_host -&gt; define key for caching we can give cookie any unique key\n}\ncache manager → activated perodically to check the state of cache and clear it based on constraints\nCache loader → runs only after ngnix start it load metadata about perv cached data\nload balancer\nTo load balance the request\nhttp {\n    upstream backend_servers {\n        server backend1.example.com:8080 weight=20;\n        server backend2.example.com:8080;\n        server backend3.example.com:8080;\n    }\n \n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        server_name example.com;\n \n        location / {\n            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;\n        }\n    }\n}\nSocket sharding\nWhen we run a server the ip and port are bind to the socket and if try to bind same ip and port again it will throw error but by using Socket sharding we can bind multiple app instance to single socket and kernel will do load balancing for the incoming request.\nConfiguring Socket Sharding\nTo enable the SO_REUSEPORT socket option, include the new reuseport parameter to the listen directive for HTTP or TCP (stream module) traffic,\nhttp {\n     server {\n          listen 80 reuseport;\n          server_name  localhost;\n          # ...\n     }\n}\n \nstream {\n     server {\n          listen 12345 reuseport;\n          # ...\n     }\n}\nRate limiting →www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/\nOptimization\nWhen a client sends an HTTP request to the NGINX server, it typically establishes a TCP connection to send and receive data.

This space is typically divided into pages or segments, which are fixed-size blocks of memory. The size of a page can vary but is often 4KB or 8KB.\nPage Table: To manage the mapping between virtual memory and physical memory, the OS maintains a data structure called a page table for each process. The page table contains entries that map virtual addresses to physical addresses. When a process accesses a memory location, the CPU uses the page table to translate the virtual address into a physical address.\nwhy we grouped the page table because if we map single byte for each byte in RAM we need more space to store the page table in memory to avoid we grouped as pages\nPage Offset: when we grouped the Page table by 4kb or 8KB to find excat memory location in RAM we use page offset\n\nLet’s say we have a page size of 4KB, which is 212212 bytes. This requires 12 bits to represent all possible byte positions within a page.\nIf we have a 32-bit virtual address, the lower 12 bits would represent the offset within the page.\nTo calculate the offset, we create a bitmask with 12 bits set to 1 (0b00000000000000000000111111111111 in binary) and perform a bitwise AND operation with the virtual address.\n\nPaging divides memory into sections or paging files. When the computer runs out of available memory, unused pages are flushed to disk using the paging file. when we try to access the page that in disk it will throw page fault os will handle and move the page from disk to memory\nA virtual memory buffer is a region of virtual memory that is used to temporarily store data that is being transferred between different parts of a system, such as between a process and a device, or between a process and the operating system.\nNote:the virtual address space dedicated to a process by the OS is 128TB on Linux and 8TB on Windows.\nTIP: IF you want to cache some file on RAM and move all other from cache cat the huge file it will be moved cache"},"notes/2024/PostgreSQL":{"title":"PostgreSQL","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Internal\n\neverything in append even when we update\nEvery connection is seprate process (max 100 connection default) because mostly people used PGBoucer as proxy in front of PostgreSQL\nthey go with this approach for fault tolrance so when one process get crashed it wont affect other but in thread it will\nWAL shared memory used to communicate between process\n\nStorage\nPostgres stores all its data in a directory sensibly called /var/lib/postgresql/data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectoryExplanation  base/Contains a subdirectory for each database. Inside each sub-directory are the files with the actual data in them. We’ll dig into this more in a second.  global/Directly contains files for cluster-wide tables like pg_database.  pg_commit_ts/As the name suggests, contains timestamps for transaction commits. We don’t have any commits or transactions yet, so this is empty.  pg_dynshmem/Postgres uses multiple processes (not multiple threads, although there has been discussion around it) so in order to share memory between processes, Postgres has a dynamic shared memory subsystem. This can use shm_open, shmget or mmap on Linux – by default it uses shm_open. The shared memory object files are stored in this folder.  pg_hba.confThis is the Host-Based Authentication (HBA) file which allows you to configure access to your cluster based on hostname. For instance, by default this file has host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust which means “trust anyone connecting to any database without a password if they’re connecting from localhost”. If you’ve ever wondered why you don’t need to put your password in when running psql on the same machine as the server, this is why.  pg_ident.confThis is a user name mapping file which isn’t particularly interesting for our purposes.  pg_logical/Contains status data for logical decoding. We don’t have time to talk about how the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) works in full, but in short, Postgres writes changes that it’s going to make to the WAL, then if it crashes it can just re-read and re-run all the operations in the WAL to get back to the expected database state. The process of turning the WAL back into the high-level operations – for the purposes of recovery, replication, or auditing – is called logical decoding and Postgres stores files related to this process in here.  pg_multixact/”xact” is what the Postgres calls transactions so this contains status data for multitransactions. Multitransactions are a thing that happens when you’ve got multiple sessions who are all trying to do a row-level lock on the same rows.  pg_notify/In Postgres you can listen for changes on a channel and notify listeners of changes. This is useful if you have an application that wants to action something whenever a particular event happens. For instance, if you have an application that wants to know every time a row is added or updated in a particular table so that it can synchronise with an external system. You can set up a trigger which notifies all the listeners whenever this change occurs. Your application can then listen for that notification and update the external data store however it wants to.  pg_replslot/Replication is the mechanism by which databases can synchronise between multiple running server instances. For instance, if you have some really important data that you don’t want to lose, you could set up a couple of replicas so that if your main database dies and you lose all your data, you can recover from one of the replicas. This can be physical replication (literally copying disk files) and logical replication (basically copying the WAL to all the replicas so that the main database can eb reconstructed from the replica’s WAL via logical decoding.) This folder contains data for the various replication slots, which are a way of ensuring WAL entries are kept for particular replicas even when it’s not needed by the main database.  pg_serial/Contains information on committed serialisable transactions. Serialisable transactions are the highest level of strictness for transaction isolation, which you can read more about in the docs.  pg_snapshots/Contains exported snapshots, used e.g. by pg_dump which can dump a database in parallel.  pg_stat/Postgres calculates statistics for the various tables which it uses to inform sensible query plans and plan executions. For instance, if the query planner knows it needs to do a sequential scan across a table, it can look at approximately how many rows are in that table to determine how much memory should be allocated. This folder contains permanent statistics files calculated form the tables. Understanding statistics is really important to analysing and fixing poor query performance.  pg_stat_tmp/Similar to pg_stat/ apart from this folder contains temporary files relating to the statistics that Postgres keeps, not the permanent files.  pg_subtrans/Subtransactions are another kind of transaction, like multitransactions. They’re a way to split a single transaction into multiple smaller subtransactions, and this folder contains status data for them.  pg_tblspc/Contains symbolic references to the different tablespaces. A tablespace is a physical location which can be used to store some of the database objects, as configured by the DB administrator. For instance, if you have a really frequently used index, you could use a tablespace to put that index on a super speedy expensive solid state drive while the rest of the table sits on a cheaper, slower disk.  pg_twophase/It’s possible to “prepare” transactions, which means that the transaction is dissociated from the current session and is stored on disk. This is useful for two-phase commits, where you want to commit changes to multiple systems at the same time and ensure that both transactions either fail and rollback or succeed and commit  PG_VERSIONThis one’s easy – it’s got a single number in which is the major version of Postgres we’re in, so in this case we’d expect this to have the number 16 in. pg_wal/This is where the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files are stored.  pg_xact/Contains status data for transaction commits, i.e. metadata logs.  postgresql.auto.confThis contains server configuration parameters, like postgresql.conf, but is automatically written to by alter system commands, which are SQL commands that you can run to dynamically modify server parameters.  postgresql.confThis file contains all the possible server parameters you can configure for a Postgres instance. This goes all the way from autovacuum_naptime to zero_damaged_pages. If you want to understand all the possible Postgres server parameters and what they do in human language, I’d highly recommend checking out postgresqlco.nf  postmaster.optsThis simple file contains the full CLI command used to invoke Postgres the last time that it was run.\nSource drew.silcock.dev/blog/how-postgres-stores-data-on-disk/\nSearch\nPostgres to create a robust search engine.

Each DSPy module has internal parameters of three kinds: (1) the LM weights, (2) the instructions, and (3) demonstrations of the input/output behavior.\nGiven a metric, DSPy can optimize all of these three with multi-stage optimization algorithms. These can combine gradient descent (for LM weights) and discrete LM-driven optimization, i.e. for crafting/updating instructions and for creating/validating demonstrations. DSPy Demonstrations are like few-shot examples, but they’re far more powerful. They can be created from scratch, given your program, and their creation and selection can be optimized in many effective ways.\nAutomatic Few-Shot Learning\n\nLabeledFewShot\nBootstrapFewShot\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch\nBootstrapFewShotWithOptuna\nKNNFewShot\n\nInternal of DSPY\n\nDspy uses pydantic Pydantic  for dspy.InputField and other things\n\nReflection Fine-Tuning\nReflection is the new fine-tuning technique where the fine-tuning prompt is changed a bit to incorporate self reflection while training the LLM, improving the results by a big margin.\nPrompt\nYou are a world-class AI system, capable of complex reasoning and reflection.  \nReason through the query inside &lt;thinking&gt; tags, and  \nthen provide your final response inside &lt;output&gt; tags.  \nIf you detect that you made a mistake in your reasoning at any point,  \ncorrect yourself inside &lt;reflection&gt; tags.\n\n\nThe model begins by generating its reasoning within &lt;thinking&gt; tags. This section contains the model’s internal thought process as it analyzes the input query.\nWithin the &lt;thinking&gt; section, the model may include &lt;reflection&gt; tags if it identifies any mistakes in its reasoning. This indicates that the model is capable of recognizing errors and will attempt to correct them before finalizing its answer.\n\nChain-of-thought (CoT)\n By leveraging in-context learning abilities, CoT prompting encourages a language model to more effectively solve complex problems by outputting along with its solution a corresponding “chain of thought” (i.e., a step-by-step explanation for how the problem was solved). The model can be prompted to generate a chain of thought via a few-shot learning approach that provides several chain of thought exemplars; see above. The CoT technique is most effective when the map from input to output is highly non-trivial; e.g., math or multi-step reasoning problems.\nNote: use COT for mathematical and reasoning where the perform good.\ncheck out here for more\nPrompt\n You are an AI assistant that uses a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach with reflection to answer queries.

The paper outlines strategies for more cost-effective and performant usage of large language model (LLM) APIs.\nThe core of FrugalGPT revolves around three key techniques for reducing LLM inference costs:\nPrompt Optimization\nPrompt Adaptation:  FrugalGPT wants us to either reduce the size of the prompt OR combine similar prompts together. Core idea is to minimise tokens and thus reduce LLM costs\nExample for email classification task we can only pick the top k similar examples. using similarity .\nFrugalGPT suggests identifying the best examples to be used instead of all of them.\nCombine similar requests together : LLMs have been found to retain context for multiple tasks together and FrugalGPT proposes to use this to group multiple requests together thus decreasing the redundant prompt examples in each request.\nBetter utilize a smaller model with a more optimized prompt :\nExample: from Claude 3.5 Sonnet to GPT-4o-mini — reducing costs massively while keeping quality high.\nCompress the prompt : The compression process happens in three main steps:\n\nToken Classification:\n\nThe trained model processes each token in the original prompt and assigns a preserve or discard probability based on the token’s importance for preserving the meaning of the text.\n\n\nSelection of Tokens:\n\nThe target compression ratio is used to decide how many tokens to retain. For example, if a 2x compression ratio is desired, 50% of the original tokens will be retained. The model sorts the tokens based on their preserve probability and selects the top tokens to keep in the compressed prompt.\n\n\nPreserve Token Order:\n\nAfter selecting the tokens to preserve, the original order of the tokens is maintained to ensure that the compressed prompt remains coherent and grammatically correct.\n\n\n\ncheck out here\n LLM Approximation\nCache LLM Requests : When the prompt is exactly the same, we can save the inference time and cost by serving the request from cache.\nFine-tune a smaller model in parallel : In a production environment, it can be massively beneficial to keep serving requests through a bigger model while continuously logging and fine-tuning a smaller model on those responses. We can then evaluate the results from the fine-tuned model and the larger model to determine when it make sense to switch.\nLLM Cascade\nThe key idea is to sequentially query different LLMs based on the confidence of the previous LLM’s response. If a cheaper LLM can provide a satisfactory answer, there’s no need to query the more expensive models, thus saving costs.\nIn essence, the LLM cascade makes a request to the smallest model first, evaluates the response, and returns it if it’s good enough. Otherwise, it requests the next larger model and so on until a satisfactory response is obtained or the largest model is reached.\nCO-STAR framework\n(C) Context: Provide background information on the task\nThis helps the LLM understand the specific scenario being discussed, ensuring its response is relevant.\n(O) Objective: Define what the task is that you want the LLM to perform\nBeing clear about your objective helps the LLM to focus its response on meeting that specific goal.\n(S) Style: Specify the writing style you want the LLM to use\nThis could be a particular famous person’s style of writing, or a particular expert in a profession, like a business analyst expert or CEO. This guides the LLM to respond with the manner and choice of words aligned with your needs.\n(T) Tone: Set the attitude of the response\nThis ensures the LLM’s response resonates with the intended sentiment or emotional context required. Examples are formal, humorous, empathetic, among others.\n(A) Audience: Identify who the response is intended for\nTailoring the LLM’s response to an audience, such as experts in a field, beginners, children, and so on, ensures that it is appropriate and understandable in your required context.\n(R) Response: Provide the response format\nThis ensures that the LLM outputs in the exact format that you require for downstream tasks. Examples include a list, a JSON, a professional report, and so on. For most LLM applications which work on the LLM responses programmatically for downstream manipulations, a JSON output format would be ideal.\n&gt; # CONTEXT # I want to advertise my company&#039;s new product. My company&#039;s name is Alpha and the product is called Beta, which is a new ultra-fast hairdryer.\n\n&gt; # OBJECTIVE # Create a Facebook post for me, which aims to get people to click on the product link to purchase it.\n\n&gt; # STYLE # Follow the writing style of successful companies that advertise similar products, such as Dyson.\n\n&gt; # TONE # Persuasive\n\n&gt; # AUDIENCE # My company&#039;s audience profile on Facebook is typically the older generation. Tailor your post to target what this audience typically looks out for in hair products.\n\n&gt; # RESPONSE # The Facebook post, kept concise yet impactful.\n\nInstance-Adaptive prompting strategy\nA prompt can vary depending on the specific instance we cannot use a same prompt for all use case\nTo overcome this limitation,  Instance-Adaptive Prompting (IAP), was suggest which aims to select the most suitable prompt for each individual question, rather than relying on a single prompt for an entire task\nHow IAP Works:\nThe IAP strategy uses these insights to select an appropriate prompt for each question from a pool of candidate prompts. They propose two methods\n\n\nSequential Substitution (IAP-ss): The system tries prompts one by one, stopping when a prompt leads to good reasoning or all prompts are exhausted. for that they use Saliency Score\n\n\nMajority Vote (IAP-mv): The system evaluates all candidate prompts and selects the one that consistently produces the best reasoning\n\n\nPrompt Decomposition\nPrompt Decomposition is the process of taking a complicated prompt and breaking it into multiple smaller parts. This is the same idea that is found in design theory and sometimes called task decomposition. Simply put, when we have a large complicated task, we break it down into multiple steps and each step is individually much easier.\nMeta Prompting\nIt involves constructing a high-level “meta” prompt that instructs an LLM\nprompt\nYou are Meta-Expert, an extremely clever expert with the unique ability to collaborate with multiple experts (such as Expert\n\nProblem Solver, Expert Mathematician, Expert Essayist, etc.) to tackle any task and solve any complex problems. Some\n\nexperts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code\n\ngiven natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when\n\ngiven clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a\n\ngiven question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., &quot;Expert Linguist&quot; or &quot;Expert Puzzle Solver&quot;), followed by a colon &quot;:&quot;, and\n\nthen provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\n\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You\n\ncan also assign personas to the experts (e.g., &quot;You are a physicist specialized in...&quot;).\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction\n\nis treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert&#039;s solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both\n\nsolutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts.\n\nKeep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your\n\ninstructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently\n\nverify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or\n\nverify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if\n\nrequired, keeping in mind they don&#039;t recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n\n&gt;&gt; FINAL ANSWER:\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n[final answer]\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option. Each question has a unique answer, so analyze the provided\n\ninformation carefully to determine the most accurate and appropriate response. Please present only one solution if you\n\ncome across multiple options.\n\nPrompt for generate System Prompt\nUnderstand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.\n- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it&#039;s simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.\n- Reasoning Before Conclusions: Encourage reasoning steps before any conclusions are reached. ATTENTION! If the user provides examples where the reasoning happens afterward, REVERSE the order! NEVER START EXAMPLES WITH CONCLUSIONS!\n    - Reasoning Order: Call out reasoning portions of the prompt and conclusion parts (specific fields by name). For each, determine the ORDER in which this is done, and whether it needs to be reversed.\n    - Conclusion, classifications, or results should ALWAYS appear last.\n- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.\n   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.\n- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.\n- Formatting: Use markdown features for readability. DO NOT USE ``` CODE BLOCKS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.\n- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.\n- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.\n- Output Format: Explicitly the most appropriate output format, in detail. This should include length and syntax (e.g. short sentence, paragraph, JSON, etc.)\n    - For tasks outputting well-defined or structured data (classification, JSON, etc.) bias toward outputting a JSON.\n    - JSON should never be wrapped in code blocks (```) unless explicitly requested.\n\nThe final prompt you output should adhere to the following structure below. Do not include any additional commentary, only output the completed system prompt. SPECIFICALLY, do not include any additional messages at the start or end of the prompt.

It is designed to define roles and organize the flow of conversation between different participants, such as system instructions, user inputs, and model responses.\nIn a typical ChatML format, the message blocks are defined by tags such as:\n\n&lt;|system|&gt;: Instructions or setup given to the model (usually hidden from the user).\n&lt;|user|&gt;: Represents what the user says.\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;: Represents the assistant’s responses.\n&lt;im_start|&gt; : the start of an interactive mode where messages will alternate between participants.

It serves as a container for identifiers (variable names, function names, class names, etc.) and helps in avoiding naming conflicts and organizing code logically.\nLocal Namespace:\n\nA local namespace contains the names that are defined within a specific function or method.\nIt is created when a function is called and is destroyed when the function exits.\nThe local namespace is accessible only within the function or method where it is defined.\n\nEnclosing Namespace (non-local):\n\nAn enclosing namespace contains names defined in the enclosing function or outer scope.\nIt is used in nested functions or closures. use keyword non-local\nNames in the enclosing namespace are accessible within the nested function but not modifiable by it.\n\nGlobal Namespace:\n\nThe global namespace contains names defined at the top level of a module or script.\nIt is created when the module is imported or when the script is executed.\n\nBuilt-in Namespace:\n\nThe built-in namespace contains names of built-in functions, exceptions, and other objects provided by Python.\nIt is automatically loaded when Python starts up.\nThe objects in __builtins__ include commonly used functions like print(), len(), range(), etc\nPython 3, __builtins__ is read-only by default.\n\n \nprint(__builtins__.len([1, 2, 3])) # Output: 3\n \ninput and output\nReading Input:\n# Reading input from the user\nuser_input = input(&quot;Enter something: &quot;)\n \n# Print the input\nprint(&quot;You entered:&quot;, user_input)\nThe input() function takes an optional string argument that serves as the prompt, which will be displayed to the user before waiting for input. It returns the user’s input as a string.\nOutput:\n# Printing output\nprint(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)\nThe print() function is used to display output to the console. You can pass one or more objects as arguments to print(), and they will be printed to the console separated by spaces by default.\nFormatting Output:\nYou can also format the output using various techniques such as string formatting or using the .format() method:\nname = &quot;Alice&quot;\nage = 30\nprint(&quot;Name: {}, Age: {}&quot;.format(name, age))\n# or\nprint(f&quot;Name: {name}, Age: {age}&quot;)\nConditional Statements:\nif-elif-else statement:\nThe if-elif-else statement is used when there are multiple conditions to check.\nx = 10\nif x &gt; 5:\n    print(&quot;x is greater than 5&quot;)\nelif x == 5:\n    print(&quot;x is equal to 5&quot;)\nelse:\n    print(&quot;x is less than 5&quot;)\nLoops:\n1. for loop:\nThe for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, etc.) or any iterable object.\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n2. while loop:\nThe while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.\nx = 0\nwhile x &lt; 5:\n    print(x)\n    x += 1\nLoop Control Statements:\n- break statement:\nThe break statement is used to exit the loop prematurely based on a condition.\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i == 5:\n        break\n    print(i)\n- continue statement:\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        continue\n    print(i)\nFunctions\ndef function_name(args):\n\tbody\nfunction will default return none\narbitrary positional and Arbitrary Keyword arguments\nPositional : When we define a parameter with *args, it allows the function to accept any number of positional arguments. These arguments are packed into a tuple inside the function\nKeyword: it allows the function to accept any number of keyword arguments. These arguments are packed into a dictionary inside the function.\n#**Positional**\n \ndef my_function(*args):\n    for arg in args:\n        print(arg)\n \nmy_function(1, 2, 3, 4)\n \n#Keyword\ndef my_function(**kwargs):\n    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n        print(key, &quot;:&quot;, value)\n \nmy_function(a=1, b=2, c=3)\n \nUnpacking arguments\nTo pass elements of a list, tuple, or dictionary as separate arguments to a function.\n   def my_function(a, b, c):\n       print(&quot;a:&quot;, a)\n       print(&quot;b:&quot;, b)\n       print(&quot;c:&quot;, c)\n \n   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n   my_function(*my_list)\n   \n   my_dict = {&#039;a&#039;: 1, &#039;b&#039;: 2, &#039;c&#039;: 3}\n   my_function(**my_dict) \n   # the function params need to have same name as keys in dict\nLambda Functions\nLambda functions, also known as anonymous functions,\nlambda arguments: expression\nLambda functions are typically used when you need a simple function for a short period, often as an argument to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(), or within a list comprehension.\nadd = lambda x, y: x + y\nprint(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\nGenerators\nGenerators are functions that can pause and resume their execution. They generate a sequence of values lazily, one value at a time, and only when requested.\ndef countdown(n):\n    while n &gt; 0:\n        yield n\n        n -= 1\n \n# Using the generator in a loop\nfor i in countdown(5):\n    print(i)\n    \n \ngen = countdown(3)\n \nprint(next(gen))  # Output: 3\nprint(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n \nMemory Efficiency: Generators produce values on-the-fly, so they don’t store the entire sequence in memory at once. This makes them memory efficient, particularly for large datasets.\nLazy Evaluation: Values are generated only when requested, which can improve performance and reduce unnecessary computation.\nSupport for Infinite Sequences: Generators can produce infinite sequences of values without running out of memory or crashing the program.\nDecorators\nAllows us to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. They provide a clean and concise way to add functionality to existing code without modifying it directly.\n \ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(&quot;Before&quot;)\n        func()\n        print(&quot;After&quot;)\n    return wrapper\n \n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello():\n    print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)\n \nsay_hello()\n \n#output\nBefore\nHello! \nAfter\nWhen we give multiple decorator it will excute from bottom to top\nModules\nWhen a Python module is imported, it gets its own __name__ attribute. This attribute contains the name of the module. Additionally, modules have a __file__ attribute, which stores the path to the module’s source file.\nimport my_module \nimport my_module as mm #**Module Aliases**\nfrom my_module import my_function` #**Importing Specific Items**\nWhen Python executes a script, it assigns the special variable __name__ a value of &quot;__main__&quot; if the script is being run directly. By using if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:, we can write code that will only execute when the script is run directly and not when it’s imported as a module.\n# my_script.py\n \ndef main():\n    print(&quot;This is the main function.&quot;)\n \nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    main()\n \nImport module resolution\nsys.path: Python maintains a list of directories called sys.path where it searches for modules when you import them. This list includes several default locations such as:\n\nThe directory containing the script that is being executed.\nThe directories listed in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.\nThe installation-dependent default path, which typically includes standard library directories, site-packages directories, etc.\n\nsite-packages Directory: When you install third-party packages using tools like pip, they are typically installed into a directory called site-packages. This directory contains modules and packages installed via pip and is added to sys.path.\ndir(modulename) #print all function present in module\nprint(help(modulename))\n#my_package/pythonscript.py\n \nfrom my_package import pythonscript #will import the whole file\npythonscript.myfunc()\n \nfrom my_package.pythonscript import myfunc\nLet say if we have two file inside single folder if we want to import both file like from foldername import * it won’t work we need to use package by creating the __init__ file\nPackages\nA package is a collection of Python modules organized in a directory hierarchy. It typically contains an __init__.py file to indicate that the directory should be treated as a package. Packages allow you to further organize your code into meaningful units.\n# my_package/__init__.py\n \n# Initialization code for the package\nprint(&quot;Initializing my_package&quot;)\n \n# Importing specific functions or classes from the package modules\nfrom .module1 import function1\nfrom .module2 import function2\n \n# Defining __all__ to specify what is exported when &#039;from my_package import *&#039; is used\n__all__ = [&#039;function1&#039;, &#039;function2&#039;]\n \nWheel files\nis a built package format for Python that helps distribute and install Python software. It is a binary distribution format, which means it contains all the files necessary for running the package without requiring a build step. This format makes installation faster and easier compared to source distributions, which need to be built on the user’s system.\nwhen we installing pkg using pip it get downloaded as wheel file.\nWheel File Structure\nA wheel file is essentially a ZIP archive with a specific naming convention and structure. The structure typically includes:\n\ndata/: Optional directory for package data files.\ndist-info/: Directory containing metadata files such as METADATA, RECORD, WHEEL, and entry_points.txt.\nname/: The package’s code files.\n\n\npycache\n__pycache__ is a directory automatically created by Python when it compiles source files into bytecode files. Python compiles source files into bytecode (.pyc) files to speed up execution by avoiding recompilation each time the script is run.\n\nWhen you import a module in Python, the interpreter first checks if there’s a corresponding bytecode file (.pyc) in the __pycache__ directory.\nIf the bytecode file exists and is up to date (i.e., the source file has not been modified since the bytecode was generated), Python uses the bytecode file for execution, bypassing the compilation step.\nIf the bytecode file does not exist or is outdated, Python compiles the source file into bytecode and stores it in the __pycache__ directory for future use.\n\nContext manger\nobjects that are used with the with statement to ensure that certain operations are properly initialized and cleaned up\nclass MyContextManager:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        # Initialization code goes here\n        print(&quot;Entering the context&quot;)\n        return self\n \n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        # Cleanup code goes here\n        print(&quot;Exiting the context&quot;)\n        # Handle exceptions if needed\n        return False  # True if exceptions are handled, False otherwise\n \n# Using the context manager with the &#039;with&#039; statement\nwith MyContextManager() as cm:\n    # Code inside the &#039;with&#039; block\n    print(&quot;Inside the context&quot;)\n \nBuiltin modules\nException handling\ntry:\n    # Code that might raise an exception\n    x = 10 / 0\nexcept Exception as e: #catch all exception\n    print(&quot;Cannot divide by zero!&quot;)\n # Handle the specific exception (ZeroDivisionError in this case)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError: \n    print(&quot;Cannot divide by zero!&quot;)\n# Handle division by zero print(&quot;Cannot divide by zero!&quot;)\n \nfinally:\n    # Optional cleanup code\n    print(&quot;This will always execute.&quot;)\n \nCustom erros:\n \n# Define a custom exception class\nclass CustomError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message=&quot;Something went wrong.&quot;):\n        self.message = message\n        super().__init__(self.message)\n \n# Raise the custom exception\ndef example_function(x):\n    if x &lt; 0:\n        raise CustomError(&quot;Input value cannot be negative.&quot;)\n        #or\n        # raise Exception(&quot;Input value cannot be negative.&quot;) \n \ntry:\n    example_function(-5)\nexcept CustomError as e:\n    print(&quot;Custom error caught:&quot;, e)\n \nOOPS\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n        self.brand = brand #attributes\n        self.model = model\n \n    def drive(self):\n        print(f&quot;Driving {self.brand} {self.model}&quot;)\n \nmy_car = Car(&quot;Toyota&quot;, &quot;Camry&quot;)\nmy_car.drive()  # Output: Driving Toyota Camry\nAttributes: Attributes are variables associated with a class or an object. They represent the state of the object. methods of attributes hasattr() , setattr(), delattr() and getattr()\nMethods:Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the object’s data. The first argument of a method is always self, which refers to the object itself.\nConstructor (__init__): The __init__ method is a special method called the constructor. It is used to initialize object attributes when an object is created.\nInheritance Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). Subclasses can override or extend the behavior of the superclass.\n   class ElectricCar(Car):\n       def __init__(self, brand, model, battery_capacity):\n           super().__init__(brand, model)\n           self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity\n \n       def charge(self):\n           print(f&quot;Charging {self.brand} {self.model} with {self.battery_capacity} kWh&quot;)\n \n   my_electric_car = ElectricCar(&quot;Tesla&quot;, &quot;Model S&quot;, 100)\n   my_electric_car.drive()   # Output: Driving Tesla Model S\n   my_electric_car.charge()  # Output: Charging Tesla Model S with 100 kWh\nClass (static) variable: are variables that are shared among all instances (objects) of a class. They are defined within a class but outside of any methods. Class variables are accessed using the class name rather than instance variables\nStatic method : It is decorated with @staticmethod to indicate that it is a static method. can be called using class name or using instance. static methods don’t have access to instance attributes or methods\nClass Methods: They have access to class variables but not to instance variables.The first parameter of a class method conventionally named cls, which refers to the class itself.\nclass Dog:\n    # Class variable\n    species = &#039;Canis familiaris&#039;\n \n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        # Instance variables\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\t\n\t@staticmethod \n\tdef static_method(): \n\t\tprint(&quot;This is a static method&quot;)\n\t\n\t@classmethod \n\tdef class_method(cls): \n\t\tprint(&quot;Class method called&quot;)\n \n# Accessing class variable using class name\nprint(Dog.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris\n \n# Creating instances of the Dog class\ndog1 = Dog(&#039;Buddy&#039;, 3)\ndog2 = Dog(&#039;Max&#039;, 5)\n \n# Accessing class variable using instance\nprint(dog1.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris\nprint(dog2.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris\n \n# Modifying class variable using class name\nDog.species = &#039;Canis lupus&#039;  # Changes species for all instances\n \n# Accessing class variable using instance after modification\nprint(dog1.species)  # Output: Canis lupus\nprint(dog2.species)  # Output: Canis lupus\nprint(hasattr())\nDunder methods: are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. These methods allow you to define behavior for built-in operations in Python.\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f&quot;({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f&quot;Point({self.x}, {self.y})&quot;\n    \n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y\n    \n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n    \n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        return Point(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)\n \n# Create two Point objects\np1 = Point(1, 2)\np2 = Point(3, 4)\n \n# Test magic methods\nprint(p1)          # Output: (1, 2)\nprint(repr(p1))    # Output: Point(1, 2)\nprint(p1 == p2)    # Output: False\nprint(p1 + p2)     # Output: Point(4, 6)\nprint(p2 - p1)     # Output: Point(2, 2)\n \nFile handling\n# Open a file for reading\nfile = open(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)\n \n# Open a file for writing\nfile = open(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)\n \n# Open a file for appending\nfile = open(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)\n \n# Read the entire file\ncontent = file.read()\n \n# Read one line at a time\nline = file.readline()\n \n# Read all lines into a list\nlines = file.readlines()\n \n# Write to a file\nfile.write(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)\n \n# Close the file \nfile.close()\n \n#using context manager\n# Open a file for writing\nwith open(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) as file:\n    file.write(&quot;Hello, World!\\n&quot;)\n    file.write(&quot;This is a Python file handling example.\\n&quot;)\n \nFile Modes\n\n&quot;r&quot;: Read mode (default). Opens a file for reading. File must exist.\n&quot;w&quot;: Write mode. Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file or truncates an existing file.\n&quot;a&quot;: Append mode. Opens a file for appending. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n&quot;b&quot;: Binary mode. Used in conjunction with other modes to open a file in binary mode (e.g., &quot;rb&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;).\n\nThreading\ncreate a new thread by subclassing the Thread class and overriding the run() method or by passing a target function to the Thread constructor.\nimport threading\n \n# Subclassing Thread class\nclass MyThread(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self):\n        print(&quot;Thread is running&quot;)\n \n# Using target function\ndef my_function():\n    print(&quot;Thread is running&quot;)\n \nthread1 = MyThread()\nthread2 = threading.Thread(target=my_function)\n \nthread1.start() \nthread2.start()\n#### Waiting for Threads to Complete\nthread1.join()\nthread2.join()\nJoin: join() method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution before continuing with the main thread. When you call join() on a thread object, the program will block and wait until that thread finishes its execution.If we want the main thread to wait for one or more additional threads to finish their execution before proceeding further, you can call the join() method on those thread objects.\nDaemon thread: Are threads that run in the background and are automatically terminated when the program exits it not like normal threads\nimport threading\nimport time\n \ndef demon_worker():\n    while True:\n        print(&quot;Demon thread is running...&quot;)\n        time.sleep(1)\n \n# Create a demon thread\ndemon_thread = threading.Thread(target=demon_worker)\ndemon_thread.daemon = True  # Set the thread as demon\n \n# Start the demon thread\ndemon_thread.start()\n \n# Main thread continues execution\nprint(&quot;Main thread continues...&quot;)\n \n# Simulate the program running for a while\ntime.sleep(5)\n \nByte code\nGenerated by the Python interpreter when it translates the source code into a form that can be executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM).\nimport dis\n \ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n \n# Use the disassemble function from the dis module to inspect the bytecode\ndis.dis(add)\n  4           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)\n              2 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)\n              4 BINARY_ADD\n              6 RETURN_VALUE\nAsync IO\nasyncio module provides infrastructure to write single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.\n\n\nCoroutines (async/await): Coroutines are special functions that can pause execution at await expressions and then resume where they left off. They are defined using async def syntax and can be paused and resumed asynchronously.\n\n\nEvent Loop: The event loop is the central component of asyncio. It manages and schedules coroutines, IO operations, and callbacks. The event loop continuously checks for events such as IO operations, callbacks, and scheduled tasks, and executes them in an asynchronous manner.\n\n\nTasks: Tasks are used to schedule coroutines for execution on the event loop. A task wraps a coroutine, allowing it to be scheduled and managed by the event loop.\n\n\nEvent Loop Policies: Event loop policies allow you to customize the event loop used by asyncio. This can be useful for integrating asyncio with other event loops or frameworks.\n\n\nimport asyncio\n \n# every async function return co-routine\nasync def hello():\n    print(&quot;Hello&quot;)\n    await asyncio.sleep(1) #do some async operation\n    print(&quot;World&quot;)\n \nasync def main():\n    await hello()\n \nasyncio.run(main())\n \n# similar to promise.all\nresult  = await asyncio.gather(*[hello(),hello()]) \n# or \n# await asyncio.gather(hello(),hello()) \n \n# async iteration\nasync for i in async_function():\n\tprint(i)\n \n#task\n \n# `asyncio.to_thread` to run blocking code in a separate thread without blocking the event loop\n \n \ndef blocking_task(n):\n    print(f&#039;Starting blocking task {n}&#039;)\n    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a delay\n    print(f&#039;Finished blocking task {n}&#039;)\n    return f&#039;Result from task {n}&#039;\n \nasync def main():\n    tasks = []\n    \n    # Use asyncio.to_thread to run blocking tasks concurrently\n    for i in range(5):\n        task = asyncio.to_thread(blocking_task, i)\n        tasks.append(task)\n \n    # Wait for all tasks to complete and gather results\n    #if one failes it won&#039;t cancel other task\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n    \n    # Print results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n \n \nCoroutine\nA coroutine is a special type of function in Python (and other programming languages) that allows you to write asynchronous code. Unlike regular functions, coroutines can pause their execution to let other code run, making them ideal for tasks that involve waiting, such as network requests or file I/O.\ncoroutine starts running when it is awaited or scheduled to run within an event loop.\nasync def my_coroutine():\n    print(&quot;Coroutine started&quot;)\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an async operation\n    print(&quot;Coroutine ended&quot;)\n \nasync def main():\n     my_coroutine()  # we not put await so the code will not be excuted\n \nasyncio.run(main())\n \nTask\ntask is a wrapper for a coroutine that allows it to run concurrently with other coroutines. if we use await it wil run one by one which is same as single thread.\nwe  can create tasks using asyncio.create_task() or loop.create_task()\nNot like gather it will cancel other task on error\n \nasync def my_coroutine(n):\n    print(f&#039;Starting task {n}&#039;)\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate a non-blocking delay\n    print(f&#039;Finished task {n}&#039;)\n    return f&#039;Result from task {n}&#039;\n \nasync def main():\n    # Create a list of tasks\n    tasks = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine(i))\n        tasks.append(task)\n \n    # Wait for all tasks to complete and gather results\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n \n    # Print results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n \n# Run the main function in the event loop\nif __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:\n    asyncio.run(main())\n \nError handling in task and gather\n\nreturn_exceptions argument to return exceptions as part of the results instead.\n\nasync def main():\n    tasks = [task_with_error(i) for i in range(5)]\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)\n \n    for result in results:\n        if isinstance(result, Exception):\n            print(f&quot;Caught an exception: {result}&quot;)\n        else:\n            print(result)\n \n# task \n \nasync def main():\n    task = asyncio.create_task(task_with_error(2))  # This will raise an error\n    try:\n        result = await task\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f&quot;Caught an exception from the task: {e}&quot;)\n \nNest async io\nnest_asyncio is a Python library that allows you to run an asyncio event loop within an already running event loop. This is particularly useful in environments like Jupyter notebooks or other interactive environments where an event loop may already be running.\n \nimport nest_asyncio\nimport asyncio\n \n# Apply the patch to allow nesting of the asyncio event loop\nnest_asyncio.apply()\n \nasync def say_hello():\n    print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n    print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)\n \nasync def main():\n    await say_hello()\n \nif __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:\n    asyncio.run(main())\n \nType hints &amp; Annotations\nIntroduced in python 3.5 above it won’t force to strict type we can give any type\n \nx:str =1 #no error\n \ndef func(a:str,b:str) -&gt; str :\n\treturn a\n \nfrom typing import List,Dict,Set,Optional,Any,Sequence,Callable,TypeVar\n \nlist : List[List[int]] = [[1,2,3]]\n \ndict : Dict[str,str] = {&quot;key&quot;:&quot;vaule&quot;}\n \n \n# Reusing type by assign to var\nVector = List[float]\n \nlist : Vector = [1.3,2.4]\n \ndef func (a:Optional[str],b:Any)\n \n#func as param first array args and last one is return type\n \ndef func(func:Callable[[int,int],[int]]):\n \n \n#Generic\nT = TypeVar(&quot;T&quot;)\n \ndef func(list:List[T])-&gt;T :\n\treturn &quot;&quot;\n \n \nif we want to force type we need to use static analysis of code using pip install mypy\n \nmypy filename.py #will strictly check the type\nOther Modules\nPydantic\nPydantic is the most widely used data validation library for Python.\n \nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import Tuple\n \nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n \n \nclass Delivery(BaseModel):\n    timestamp: datetime\n    dimensions: Tuple[int, int]\n \n \nm = Delivery(timestamp=&#039;2020-01-02T03:04:05Z&#039;, dimensions=[&#039;10&#039;, &#039;20&#039;])\nprint(repr(m.timestamp))\n#&gt; datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC))\nprint(m.dimensions)\n#&gt; (10, 20)\n \nDocstrings\nA docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. It is used to document the code and provide information about what the code does, its parameters, return values, and any other relevant details.\nA docstring is typically enclosed in triple quotes &quot;&quot;&quot;...&quot;&quot;&quot; or &#039;&#039;&#039;...&#039;&#039;&#039;, and it can span multiple lines.\ndef greet(name: str) -&gt; None:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Print a personalized greeting message.\n \n    Args:\n        name (str): The name of the person to greet.\n \n    Returns:\n        None\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    print(f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;)\n \nprint(greet.__doc__) \nhelp(greet)\nPackage mangement\nIn Python, package management and package locking are handled using tools that manage dependencies and ensure consistency across environments. The main tools that provide functionality similar to package.json and package-lock.json in JavaScript are:\n1. requirements.txt + pip\n\nrequirements.txt is a simple text file used to specify the exact versions of the Python packages your project depends on.\npip is the package manager that installs and manages these packages.\n\nTo create a requirements.txt file:\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\nTo install packages from it:\npip install -r requirements.txt\nHowever, this setup doesn’t lock exact versions for sub-dependencies (like package-lock.json does).\n2. pipenv\n\nPipenv is a modern Python packaging tool that creates two files:\n\nPipfile: Defines project dependencies.\nPipfile.lock: Locks the exact versions, including transitive dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.\n\n\n\nCommands:\n\nInstall a package:\npipenv install &lt;package_name&gt;\n\nGenerate Pipfile and Pipfile.lock and install dependencies:\npipenv install\n\n\n3. poetry\n\nPoetry is another modern package manager that also handles dependency management and version locking.\n\npyproject.toml: Similar to package.json, it contains dependency specifications.\npoetry.lock: Similar to package-lock.json, it locks all package versions and their dependencies.\n\n\n\nCommands:\n\nTo install and manage dependencies:\npoetry install\n\nAdd a package:\npoetry add &lt;package_name&gt;\n\n\n4. conda (for Anaconda users)\n\n\nConda is a package manager for Python and other languages, typically used in scientific computing.\n\n\nenvironment.yml: Similar to package.json, this file defines all packages and their versions, along with specific channels.\n\n\nYou can export a lock file using:\nconda env export &gt;

The component itself does not render anything besides the render prop. Instead, the component simply calls the render prop, instead of implementing its own rendering logic.\nIt is similar to higher order component\n \nimport React, { useState } from &#039;react&#039;;\n \nclass MouseTracker extends React.Component {\n  state = { x: 0, y: 0 };\n \n  handleMouseMove = (event) =&gt; {\n    this.setState({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });\n  };\n \n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;div style={{ height: &#039;100vh&#039; }} onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}&gt;\n        {this.props.render(this.state)}\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nfunction App(){\nreturn (\n \n&lt;MouseTracker \n\trender={({ x, y }) =&gt; ( &lt;p&gt; Mouse position: ({x}, {y}) &lt;/p&gt; )} \n/&gt;\n)\n}\n \nHigher order component\n To share tracking logic across various UX components. if more one UI will have same function that need to share and UI is differ use this pattern\n \nimport tracker from &#039;./tracker.js&#039;;\n \n// HOC\nconst pageLoadTracking = (ComposedComponent) =&gt; class HOC extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    tracker.trackPageLoad(this.props.trackingData);\n  }\n \n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    tracker.trackPageLoad(this.props.trackingData);\n  }\n \n  render() {\n    return &lt;ComposedComponent {...this.props} /&gt;\n  }\n};\n \n// Usage\nimport LoginComponent from &quot;./login&quot;;\n \nconst LoginWithTracking = pageLoadTracking(LoginComponent);\n \nclass SampleComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const trackingData = {/** Nested Object **/};\n    return &lt;LoginWithTracking trackingData={trackingData}/&gt;\n  }\n}\nConvention need to follow\n\nA HOC should not change the API of a provided component\nHOCs should have a name following the withNoun pattern\nHOCs should not have any parameters aside from the Component itself.

Here’s an example:\nimport { useState, useCallback } from &quot;react&quot;;\n \nclass BigObject {\n  public readonly data = new Uint8Array(1024 * 1024 * 10);\n}\n \nexport const App = () =&gt; {\n  const [countA, setCountA] = useState(0);\n  const [countB, setCountB] = useState(0);\n  const bigData = new BigObject(); // 10MB of data\n \n  const handleClickA = useCallback(() =&gt; {\n    setCountA(countA + 1);\n  }, [countA]);\n \n  const handleClickB = useCallback(() =&gt; {\n    setCountB(countB + 1);\n  }, [countB]);\n \n  // This only exists to demonstrate the problem\n  const handleClickBoth = () =&gt; {\n    handleClickA();\n    handleClickB();\n    console.log(bigData.data.length);\n  };\n \n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={handleClickA}&gt;Increment A&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={handleClickB}&gt;Increment B&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={handleClickBoth}&gt;Increment Both&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        A: {countA}, B: {countB}\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nThe first click on “Increment A” will cause handleClickA() to be recreated since we change countA - let’s call the new one handleClickA()#1.\nhandleClickB()#0 will not get recreated since countB didn’t change.\nThis means, however, that handleClickB()#0 will still hold a reference to the previous AppScope#0.\nThe new handleClickA()#1 will hold a reference to AppScope#1, which holds a reference to handleClickB()#0.\n\nThe general problem is that different useCallback hooks in a single component might reference each other and other expensive data through the closure scopes. The closures are then held in memory until the useCallback hooks are recreated. Having more than one useCallback hook in a component makes it super hard to reason about what’s being held in memory and when it’s being released. The more callbacks you have, the more likely it is that you’ll encounter this issue.\nResources\n\n[React re-renders guide: everything, all at once](www.developerway.com/posts/react-re-renders-guide\nReact Element, children, parents and re-renders\nWhen does React re-render components?\nreacthandbook.dev/react-performance-optimization\nBlogged Answers: A (Mostly) Complete Guide to React Rendering Behavior\nPerformance using React Profiler\n\nPatterns\n\nComponent composition\nComponent composition\nReact components composition\nfelixgerschau.com/react-component-composition/#how-can-composition-help-performance\nEffective Higher-Order Components\nkentcdodds.com/blog/optimize-react-re-renders\n\nState Mangement\nSimplifying React state management\n\nThey use re select npm pkg for manipulating data from different store\n\nAdvanced\n\nmedium.com/the-guild/under-the-hood-of-reacts-hooks-system-eb59638c9dba How hooks works under the hood\nstackoverflow.com/questions/53974865/how-do-react-hooks-determine-the-component-that-they-are-for\nwebdeveloper.beehiiv.com/p/build-react-400-lines-code\nblog.frontend-almanac.com/JqtGelofzm1\n\nPkg\n\nState mangement like context but re-render only when actual val change\nA collection of modern, server-safe React hooks\n\n\nNeed to arrange\nReact clone element for component compositon\nDo you need to calculate the state from a state or props you already have Do that in the component and not in useEffect\nDo you update state in useEffect when a prop changes?

Macros are essentially functions that generate code at compile-time, allowing you to create new syntax, abstractions, and domain-specific languages (DSLs) within Rust.\nMacros are defined using the macro keyword, followed by the name of the macro and a set of rules that define how the macro should be expanded. When the macro is invoked, the Rust compiler will replace the macro invocation with the expanded code.\nMacros need to be call with !\nmacro_rules! greet {\n    ($name:expr) =&gt; {\n        println!(&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;, $name);\n    };\n}\n \nfn main() {\n    greet!(&quot;Alice&quot;);\n    greet!(&quot;Bob&quot;);\n}\nTypes of Macros in Rust:\n\nDeclarative Macros: These macros are defined using the macro_rules! syntax and are used to generate code at compile-time.\nProcedural Macros: These macros are defined using the proc_macro attribute and are used to generate code at compile-time using a procedural interface.\nAttribute Macros: These macros are used to attach attributes to items, such as functions or structs.\n\nBuiltin Macro\n1. println!: Prints its arguments to the standard output, followed by a newline character.\n2. vec!: Creates a new vector with the specified elements.\n3. format!: Formats its arguments into a string.\n4. assert!: Asserts that a condition is true, and panics if it’s false.\n5. assert_eq!: Asserts that two values are equal, and panics if they’re not.\n6. assert_ne!: Asserts that two values are not equal, and panics if they are.\n7. panic!: Panics with a custom message.\n8. unimplemented!: Panics with a message indicating that a function or method is not implemented.\n9. todo!: Panics with a message indicating that a function or method is not implemented, and suggests that it should be implemented.\n10. include!: Includes the contents of a file into the current module.\n11. include_str!: Includes the contents of a file as a string.\n12. module!: Defines a new module.\n13. concat!: Concatenates its arguments into a single string.\n14. stringify!: Converts its argument into a string.\n15. debug_assert!: Asserts that a condition is true, and panics if it’s false, but only in debug builds.\nFunction\nfn main() {\n    // 1.

designed for multi-terabyte or petabyte workloads and high-performance applications\n\nArchitecture\n\nScyllaDB has a symmetric architecture, with each node divided into two layers: coordination and storage\nEach node has a full connection mesh, allowing for efficient communication between nodes\nThe database uses a thread-per-core architecture, with each thread having its own scheduler\n\nPerformance\n\nScyllaDB is designed to be highly efficient, with a focus on minimizing coordination and locking overhead\nIt uses asynchronous I/O and networking to improve performance\nThe database is self-tuning, with a feedback loop that adjusts the scheduler to optimize performance\n\nConcurrency\n\nScyllaDB is designed to handle high concurrency, with a focus on minimizing latency\nIt uses a scheduling algorithm to manage concurrency and prioritize requests\nThe database tracks metadata about each request, including the originating process and priority\n\nI/O and Networking\n\nScyllaDB uses Linux AIO and epoll for I/O and networking\nIt has a custom TCP/IP stack, but it is not currently used due to deployment issues\nThe database is designed to work with iouring, but it is not currently supported\n\nCooperative Scheduling\n\nScyllaDB uses a cooperative scheduling model, where tasks yield control back to the scheduler voluntarily\nThis approach allows for efficient scheduling and minimizes latency\nThe database uses a preemption timer to ensure that tasks do not run for too long without yielding control\n\nthere is primary seconday nodes all

It simply states that the maximum speed up will be limited by the serial fraction of the task execution as it will create resource contention.\none woman nine months to make one baby, “nine women can’t make a baby in one month\nAssume if have 3 thread that doing a single task  it take 2 sec but the most of the time will spend on maintining the 3 thread and resources sharing\nParellel process are efficient when they are independt\n\n\nUniversal Scalability Law\n\nsays that actual speedup is even worse than Amdahl’s law due to shared variables. USL defines a new parameter coherency, which is the overhead added by communication between multiple processes, threads, or nodes.\n\n\nLatency and Utilization Trade-offs\n\nOnly a single thread can use the most resources at a given time, which forces threads to wait and take turns\n\n\nDesigning for Throughput with the Maximal Useful  Utilization (MUU) Model\nAdding Latency Limits\n\n\nOptimization Techniques\nTo effectively optimize, it’s crucial to identify where the bottlenecks occur. Bottlenecks typically manifest in one of three forms:\n\nResource Bottleneck: One of the resources (e.g., CPU, I/O, or memory) is the limiting factor.\nThread Model Bottleneck: Thread models are causing critical resources to be idle.\nResource Waste: Resources are being wasted on nonessential tasks (e.g., context switches, garbage collection).\n\nCPU Optimization Techniques\n\nOptimize Individual Tasks: Improve the efficiency of specific tasks that use CPU resources.\nOptimize Memory: Ensure that memory usage is efficient to reduce the CPU’s burden.\nMaximize CPU Utilization: Ensure that the CPU is used to its fullest potential without unnecessary idling.\n\nI/O Optimization Techniques\n\nAvoid I/O: Use caching to minimize direct I/O operations.\nBuffering: Implement buffering to handle I/O operations more efficiently.\nSend Early, Receive Late, Don’t Ask but Tell: Design systems to send data early and receive it late, and use push-based communication rather than pull-based.\nPrefetching: Load data before it’s needed to reduce wait times.\nAppend-Only Processing: Use append-only structures (e.g., Kafka) to improve I/O performance.\n\nMemory Optimization Techniques\n\nReduce Cache Misses: Minimize the number of cache misses to improve memory access efficiency.\n\nLatency Optimization Techniques\n\nDo Work in Parallel: Utilize parallel processing to reduce overall latency.\nReduce I/O: Minimize I/O operations to lower latency.\n\nCPU Utilization is Wrong\n\nCPU utilization is a metric that measures the percentage of time the CPU spends executing non-idle tasks. It doesn’t necessarily mean the CPU is busy with computation; it’s more about the time the CPU is not running the idle thread.\nThe idle thread is a special task that runs when the CPU has no other tasks to perform. The operating system kernel tracks CPU utilization during context switches.\nSo  high %CPU to mean that the processing unit is the bottleneck, which is wrong because CPU is capable of doing the process it may wait for I/O or something .\nSource: opensource.com/article/18/4/cpu-utilization-wrong\n\nThe USE Method\nThe Utilization Saturation and Errors (USE) Method is a methodology for analyzing the performance of any system.\nFor every resource, check the following:\n\nUtilization: The average time that the resource was busy servicing work.\nSaturation: The degree to which the resource has extra work it can’t service, often resulting in a queue.\nErrors: The count of error events associated with the resource.\n\nResources: This includes all physical server functional components, such as CPUs, disks, buses, etc.\nReferences\n\nFarnam Street: Mental Models\nHigh Scalability: Big List of 20 Common Bottlenecks\nOpenSource.com: CPU Utilization Misconceptions\nWikipedia: Queueing Theory\nBrendan Gregg: USE Method\nMedium: What Makes Apache Kafka So Fast\nAn Analysis of Web Servers Architectures Performances on Commodity Multicore\nMIT OpenCourseWare: Advanced Data Structures\n\nUnderstanding User Experience (UX)\nFew concepts or principles that help us to design a good UX:\n\nUnderstand the Users\nDo as Little as Possible\nGood Products Do Not Need a Manual: Its Use Is Self-Evident\nThink in Terms of Information Exchange\n\nUsers come to our system to get something done.

This type of analysis helps in detecting potential errors, vulnerabilities, coding standard violations, and performance issues early in the development cycle. Static analysis tools automatically review the code to find issues like:\n\nSyntax errors: Mistakes in the structure of the code.\nCoding standard violations: Ensures adherence to predefined coding guidelines (e.g., consistent naming conventions).\nSecurity vulnerabilities: Identifies potential security risks like SQL injection or buffer overflow.\nPerformance issues: Finds inefficient code that may cause performance bottlenecks.\nDead code: Code that is never used or executed.\n\nCodeQL\nCodeQL enables you to query code as though it were data. Write a query to find all variants of a vulnerability, eradicating it forever. Then share your query to help others do the same.\nWorking with CodeQL involves setting up the tool, creating or running predefined queries, and analyzing the results. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get started with CodeQL:\n1. Install CodeQL CLI\nThe CodeQL CLI (Command-Line Interface) is required to create and analyze databases from your source code. Follow these steps to install it:\n\nDownload CodeQL CLI: Get it from the official GitHub CodeQL releases page.\nUnzip the download and move the codeql binary to your system’s PATH.\n\n2. Initialize a CodeQL Database\nYou’ll need to create a CodeQL database for the code you want to analyze. This database is a representation of your source code that CodeQL can query.\n# Create a CodeQL database for a project (specify the language)\ncodeql database create codeql-db --language=javascript\nThis command will analyze the code and store it in a CodeQL database, which can later be queried.\n3. Run Queries\nOnce you have the database, you can either run predefined queries or create your own. GitHub provides a library of CodeQL queries for security and code quality. You can clone the query repository:\ngit clone github.com/github/codeql.git\nNow, run a query on your database:\n# Run a query (replace &lt;query-file&gt; with the actual query path)\ncodeql query run codeql-repo/javascript/ql/src/Security/CWE/CWE-079/ReflectedXss.ql --database=codeql-db\nThis will execute the query and return any potential issues in the code.\n4. View Results\nResults of CodeQL queries can be exported in various formats (JSON, SARIF) for detailed analysis:\n# Run the query and output the results in SARIF format (useful for GitHub Code Scanning)\ncodeql query run codeql-repo/javascript/ql/src/Security/CWE/CWE-079/ReflectedXss.ql --database=codeql-db --format=sarif &gt; result.sarif\nSARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) is a standardized output format that you can upload to platforms like GitHub for easier viewing.\n5. Custom Queries (Optional)\nYou can write your own custom queries in CodeQL. The language is declarative and SQL-like, allowing you to search for patterns in your code.\nHere’s an example of a simple query that finds unused variables in JavaScript:\nimport javascript\n \nfrom Variable v\nwhere not exists (v.getAnAccess())\nselect v, &quot;Unused variable.&quot;\nTo run this query:\ncodeql query run custom-query.ql --database=codeql-db\nSemgrep\nLightweight static analysis for many languages.

Instead of splitting each table across many databases, we would move groups of tables onto their own databases. This proved to have both short- and long-term benefits: Vertical partitioning relieves our original database now, while providing a path forward for horizontally sharding subsets of our tables in the future.\nThey identify which tables can be split by using  average active sessions (AAS) for queries, which describes the average number of active threads dedicated to a given query at a certain point in time. We calculated this information by querying pg_stat_activity in 10 millisecond intervals to identify CPU waits associated with a query, and then aggregated the information by table name\nThey choose the table which will not do joins and required transactions\nMigration approach\n\nPrepare client applications to query from multiple database partitions\nReplicate tables from original database to a new database until replication lag is near 0\nPause activity on original database\nWait for databases to synchronize\nReroute query traffic to the new database\nResume activity\n\nNote: To fast down the  logical replication on they removed the indexing and add the indexing after everythings compeleted\nThey used Log Sequence Number (it is a unique identifier assigned to each transaction log entry, representing the order in which changes were made to the database.

This provided a friendly abstraction for developers to interact with horizontally sharded tables.\nshard key → selected a handful of sharding keys like UserID, FileID, or OrgID. Almost every table at Figma could be sharded using one of these keys.\nThey group the table in same sharding if they comes under single domain and they have same shard key such that the query will support join and transaction\nExample: Imagine Figma has a colo named “UserColo” that includes tables related to user data. Within this colo, there are tables such as “Users”, “UserPreferences”, and “UserActivity”. Each of these tables is sharded based on the UserID, ensuring that data related to a specific user is stored together on the same shard.\nLogical Sharding and Physical Sharding\nFirst they did Logical Sharding that involves partitioning or organizing data at the application layer in a way that simulates horizontal sharding without physically distributing the data across multiple shards.\nThen after sucess of logical they implement Physical Sharding that involves the actual distribution of data across multiple backend database servers\n DBProxy service that intercepts SQL queries generated by our application layer, and dynamically routes queries to various Postgres databases. build with GO\n The job is\n - A query parser reads SQL sent by the application and transforms it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n\nA logical planner parses the AST and extracts the query type (insert, update, etc) and logical shard IDs from the query plan.\nA physical planner maps the query from logical shard IDs to physical databases.

With thousands of database shards distributed across Stripe’s product applications, sharding enables efficient data distribution and parallel processing.\nStripe’s database infrastructure team developed a fleet of database proxy servers implemented in Golang. These proxy servers handle the task of routing queries to the correct shard.\nWhen an application sends a query to a database proxy server, it performs the following steps:\n\nParsing the query\nRouting it to one or more shards\nCombining the results received from the shards\nReturning the final result to the application\n\nCaching\nDoorDash’s\nThey use Layered caches\n\nRequest local cache: Lives only for the lifetime of the request; uses a simple HashMap.\nLocal cache: Visible to all workers within a single Java virtual machine; uses a Caffeine cache for heavy lifting.\nRedis cache: Visible to all pods sharing the same Redis cluster; uses Lettuce client.\n\nThey have Runtime feature flag control to enable and disable the caching in layer\nCache invalidation\n\nUsing Change Data Capture events emitted when database tables are updated\n The cache could be invalidated directly within the application code when data changes.

A partition is typically composed of MySQL nodes backed by NVMe SSDs, which are capable of handling heavy read and write workloads. Additionally, data is sharded across multiple partitions containing one leader and two follower nodes using Raft for consensus.\nCacheFront\nSince Docstore’s query engine layer is responsible for serving reads and writes to clients, it is well suited to integrate the caching layer. It also decouples the cache from disk-based storage, allowing us to scale either of them independently. The query engine layer implements an interface to Redis for storing cached data along with a mechanism to invalidate cached entries\nCacheFront uses a cache aside strategy to implement cached reads:\n\nQuery engine layer gets read request for one more rows\nIf caching is enabled, try getting rows from Redis; stream response to users\nRetrieve remaining rows (if any) from the storage engine\nAsynchronously populate Redis with the remaining rows\nStream remaining rows to users\n\nCache Invalidation\nThey used Change Data Capture for Cache Invalidation they have publisher which will  publishes the events for each update in DB and they have consumer which will listen for the changes and do invalidation in Cache\nCache key\nThey used below format\nRK{&lt;tablename} | &lt;PARTIONkEY&gt;| &lt;ROWKEY&gt;|&lt;INSTANCE&gt;}\nCache Warming\nA Docstore instance spawns two different geographical regions to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. they both have two seprate redis in there region\n In case of a region failover, another region must be able to serve all requests.\nIf we have two region we need to sync db and cache data among the region such that if one region get down we will get data from other region but the problem is for the Docstore has its own cross-region replication mechanism. If we replicate the cache content using Redis cross-region replication, we will have two independent replication mechanisms, which could lead to cache vs. storage engine inconsistency\nSo to solve this they tail the Redis write stream and replicate keys to the remote region. In the remote region instead of directly updating the remote cache, read requests are issued to the query engine layer which, upon a cache miss, reads from the database and writes to the cache such that now both region have same consistent data.\nCircuit Breakers\nIf a Redis node goes down, we’d like to be able to short circuit requests to that node to avoid the unnecessary latency penalty of a Redis get/set request\nTo achieve this, we use a sliding window circuit breaker. We count the number of errors on each node per time bucket and compute the number of errors in the sliding window width.\nAvoiding DB overload on cache down: let say the redis node is down then suddenly all request will forward to DB. db will be overloaded to avoid that they dynamically adjust the db timeout of the query\nFacebook\nHow Meta Achieves 99.99999999% Cache Consistency:\ncommon race condition for inconsistency:\n\nThe client queries the cache for a value not present in it\nSo the cache queries the database for the value: x = 0\nIn the meantime, the value in the database gets changed: x = 1\nBut the cache invalidation event reaches the cache first: x = 1\nThen the value from cache fill reaches the cache: x = 0\n\nTo solve this  they created  observability solution.\nMonitoring\nThey created a separate service to monitor cache inconsistency &amp; called it Polaris\n\nIt acts like a cache server &amp; receives cache invalidation events\nThen it queries cache servers to find data inconsistency\nIt queues inconsistent cache servers &amp; checks again later\nIt checks data correctness during writes, so finding cache inconsistency is faster\nSimply put, it measures cache inconsistency\nPolaris queries the database at timescales of 1, 5, or 10 minutes. It lets them back off efficiently &amp; improve accuracy.\n\nTracing\n\nIt logs only data changes that occur during the race condition time window. Thus log storage becomes cheaper\nIt keeps an index of recently modified data to determine if the next data change must be logged\nPolaris reads logs if cache inconsistency is found &amp; then sends notifications\n\nLogging\nPinterest\nSearch\nTwitter\nTo achieve stability and scalability, they used Open Distro for Elasticsearch, but added a proxy and two services: Ingestion Service and Backfill Service.\nThe proxy separates read and write traffic from clients, handles client authentication, and provides additional metrics and flexible routing and throttling. This design creates a single entry point for all requests and makes it easier for customers to build solutions.\nThe Ingestion Service was introduced to handle large traffic spikes. It queues requests from clients into a Kafka topic, and worker clients then send the requests to the Elasticsearch cluster. The service batches requests, listens to back-pressure, auto-throttles, and retries with backoff, smoothing out traffic to the cluster and preventing overload."},"notes/2024/System-Design":{"title":"System Design","links":[],"tags":[],"content":" problems in a distributed system\n\nmaintaining the system state (liveness of nodes)\ncommunication between nodes\nsolutions\ncentralized state management service (Apache Zookeeper)\npeer-to-peer state management service  (gossip protocol)\n\nGossip Protocol\nevery node periodically sends out a message to a subset of other random nodes.

Mamba is a good example to bring back recurrence.\nHow do LSTMs work?\n1.Given\n↳ 🟨 Input sequence X1, X2, X3 (d = 3)\n↳ 🟩 Hidden state h (d = 2)\n↳ 🟦 Memory C (d = 2)\n↳ Weight matrices Wf, Wc, Wi, Wo\nProcess t = 1\n2.Initialize\n↳ Randomly set the previous hidden state h0 to [1, 1] and memory cells C0 to [0.3, -0.5]\n3.Linear Transform\n↳ Multiply the four weight matrices with the concatenation of current input (X1) and the previous hidden state (h0).\n↳ The results are feature values, each is a linear combination of the current input and hidden state.\n4.Non-linear Transform\n↳ Apply sigmoid σ to obtain gate values (between 0 and 1).\n• Forget gate (f1): [-4, -6] → [0, 0]\n• Input gate (i1): [6, 4] → [1, 1]\n• Output gate (o1): [4, -5] → [1, 0]\n↳ Apply tanh to obtain candidate memory values (between -1 and 1)\n• Candidate memory (C’1): [1, -6] → [0.8, -1]\n5.Update Memory\n↳ Forget (C0 .* f1): Element-wise multiply the current memory with forget gate values.\n↳ Input (C’1 .* o1): Element-wise multiply the “candidate” memory with input gate values.\n↳ Update the memory to C1 by adding the two terms above: C0 .* f1 + C’1 .* o1 = C1\n6.Candiate Output\n↳ Apply tanh to the new memory C1 to obtain candidate output o’1.\n[0.8, -1] → [0.7, -0.8]\n7.Update Hidden State\n↳ Output (o’1 .* o1 → h1): Element-wise multiply the candidate output with the output gate.\n↳ The result is updated hidden state h1\n↳ Also, it is the first output.\nProcess t = 2\n8.Initialize\n↳ Copy previous hidden state h1 and memory C1\n9.Linear Transform\n↳ Repeat [3]\n10.Update Memory (C2)\n↳ Repeat [4] and [5]\n11.Update Hidden State (h2)\n↳ Repeat [6] and [7]\nProcess t = 3\n12.Initialize\n↳ Copy previous hidden state h2 and memory C2\n13.Linear Transform\n↳ Repeat [3]\n14.Update Memory (C3)\n↳ Repeat [4] and [5]\n15.Update Hidden State (h3)\n↳ Repeat [6] and [7]\n\ncolah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/\n\n\nBiLSTM\nA Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is used to process sequential data. It extends the standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model by introducing the concept of bidirectionality, allowing the model to have both forward and backward information about the sequence.\nThe architecture of a BiLSTM is as follows:\n\nInput Layer: Takes the input sequence.\nEmbedding Layer: Converts the input tokens to dense vectors (embeddings).\nForward LSTM Layer: Processes the input sequence from start to end.\nBackward LSTM Layer: Processes the input sequence from end to start.\nConcatenation Layer: Combines the outputs from both the forward and backward LSTM layers.\nDense Layer: Optional layer(s) for further processing.\nOutput Layer: Produces the final predictions.\n\nTypes\nEncoder-only\nThese models convert an input sequence of text into a rich numerical representa‐\ntion that is well suited for tasks like text classification or named entity recogni‐\ntion. BERT and its variants, like RoBERTa and DistilBERT, belong to this class of\narchitectures.\nDecoder-only\nGiven a prompt of text like “Thanks for lunch, I had a…” these models will auto-\ncomplete the sequence by iteratively predicting the most probable next word.\nThe family of GPT models belong to this class.\nEncoder-decoder\nThese are used for modeling complex mappings from one sequence of text to\nanother; they’re suitable for machine translation and summarization tasks. In\naddition to the Transformer architecture, which as we’ve seen combines an\nencoder and a decoder, the BART and T5 models belong to this class.\n\nquery — asking for information\nkey — saying that it has some information\nvalue — giving the information\n\nAttention\nThe self-attention mechanism involves three main components:\n\nQuery (Q): The query is the token that is being processed.\nKey (K): The key is the token to which we are checking compatibility with the query.\nValue (V): The value is the actual representation vector of the token.\n\nFor each word embedding we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector. Their dimensionality is 64, while the embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512.\nStep 1: Calculate Query, Key, and Value Vectors\nThe first step is to multiply each of the input vectors with three weights matrices (W(Q), W(K), W(V)) that are trained during the training process. This matrix multiplication will give us three vectors for each of the input vectors: the query vector, the key vector, and the value vector.\nimport numpy as np\n \n# Input vectors\ninput_vectors = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n \n# Weights matrices\nW_Q = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]])\nW_K = np.array([[0.9, 0.8, 0.7], [0.6, 0.5, 0.4], [0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\nW_V = np.array([[0.5, 0.6, 0.7], [0.8, 0.9, 0.1], [0.2, 0.3, 0.4]])\n \n# Calculate query, key, and value vectors\nquery_vectors = np.dot(input_vectors, W_Q)\nkey_vectors = np.dot(input_vectors, W_K)\nvalue_vectors = np.dot(input_vectors, W_V)\n \n# Calculate attention scores\nattention_scores = np.dot(query_vectors, key_vectors.T)\n \n#The third step is to divide the attention scores by the square root of the dimensions of the key vector\n \nscaled_attention_scores = attention_scores / np.sqrt(key_vectors.shape[1])\nExample\n# Input vectors for the sentence &quot;I am going to play&quot;\ninput_vectors = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]])\n \n# Calculate query, key, and value vectors\nquery_vectors = np.dot(input_vectors, W_Q)\nkey_vectors = np.dot(input_vectors, W_K)\nvalue_vectors = np.dot(input_vectors, W_V)\n \n# Calculate attention scores for the word &quot;going&quot; \n#key_vectors.T -&gt; transpose matrics\nattention_scores = np.dot(query_vectors[2], key_vectors.T)\n \n# Scale attention scores\nscaled_attention_scores = attention_scores / np.sqrt(key_vectors.shape[1])\n \n# Apply softmax\nattention_weights = np.exp(scaled_attention_scores) / np.sum(np.exp(scaled_attention_scores), axis=-1, keepdims=True) 17\n \n# Calculate final representation of the word &quot;going&quot;\nfinal_representation = np.dot(attention_weights, value_vectors)\nSingle formula for repersentating above\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q * K^T / sqrt(d)) * V\nwhere:\n\nQ is the query vector\nK is the key vector\nV is the value vector\nd is the dimensionality of the key vector\n^T denotes the transpose operation\nsoftmax is the softmax function\n* denotes the matrix multiplication operation\n\n\nEach word in the input sequence is embedded into a vector space using a learned embedding matrix.\nFor each word, three vectors are computed: Q, K, and V. These vectors are computed by applying three separate linear transformations to the word’s embedding vector.\nThe Q vector is used as a query to compute attention weights with respect to all other words in the sequence. This is done by taking the dot product of the Q vector with the K vectors of all other words, and applying a softmax function to obtain a set of attention weights.\nThe attention weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the V vectors of all other words, which produces the output of the self-attention mechanism.\n\nOptimizer and loss function\nOptimizer: The optimizer in a Transformer model refers to the algorithm used to update the model parameters during training in order to minimize the loss function. Some common optimizers used in Transformer models include:\n\n\nAdam (Adaptive Moment Estimation): This is a popular optimizer that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent, namely AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n\n\nAdamW: This is a variant of Adam that incorporates weight decay regularization directly into the optimizer, which can stabilize training and improve generalization.\n\n\nSGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent): Though less commonly used in Transformers compared to Adam variants, SGD updates model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.\n\n\nAdaGrad and RMSProp: These are older optimizers that adjust the learning rates of model parameters based on the frequency of their updates during training.\n\n\nCasual Attention mechanism\nCausal attention is a variant of attention mechanism, commonly used in natural language processing, especially in autoregressive models like GPT and Transformer-based models for tasks like language generation. The term “causal” refers to the property that the attention mechanism ensures that the model only attends to past tokens when predicting the next token. This is essential for autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially, one at a time, and should not “look ahead” into future tokens.\nWhile causal attention has benefits in sequence generation, it comes at the cost of reduced parallelism during training, especially when compared to bidirectional attention models like BERT, where all tokens attend to each other.\nSGD\nBatch Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters for the entire training dataset and updates the parameters once per iteration. This can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\nStochastic Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient of the loss function for each training example individually and updates the parameters for each training example. This makes SGD much faster and more efficient for large datasets.\nLoss Function: The loss function in a Transformer model defines the objective that the optimizer seeks to minimize during training. For tasks like machine translation or language modeling, common loss functions include:\n\n\nCross-Entropy Loss: This is widely used in classification tasks and measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n\n\nSequence-to-Sequence Loss: Specifically designed for tasks where the model outputs a sequence (such as machine translation), this loss function considers the entire predicted sequence and compares it with the target sequence.\n\n\nMasked Language Modeling Loss: Used in models like BERT (which uses Transformer architecture), this loss function helps the model learn to predict masked words within a sentence.\n\n\nPerplexity: In language modeling tasks, perplexity is often used as an evaluation metric that correlates with the cross-entropy loss. Lower perplexity indicates a better-performing model.\n\n\nLogits\nLogits are the raw, unnormalized scores or outputs from a machine learning model, often used in classification tasks. In simpler terms, logits represent the values produced by a neural network before applying an activation function like softmax or sigmoid, which converts these raw values into probabilities.\nHow it used in GPT\n\nAfter tokenization, the tokens are passed through the model (like GPT). The model is a neural network that predicts the next token in the sequence based on the previous ones.\nThe model outputs logits for each possible token in its vocabulary. If the model has a vocabulary of 50,000 tokens, it will produce 50,000 logits as raw scores for each token after processing the current input sequence.\nThe logits are then passed through a softmax function to convert them into a probability distribution over the vocabulary. The softmax function transforms the logits into probabilities that sum to 1, which indicates how likely each token is to follow the current sequence.\n\nBERT Model\nhas 768 feature vector for embedding and BERT has a fixed vocabulary of 30,000 words (or tokens).\nGPT-3 has 50,257 words of voc and 12288 dimension\nquery,key  have  128 * 12,288 dimension\nvaule  = 12288 * 12288\n96 head attention\nHas 12 layer of encoder only\nHandling Unknown Words\n\nSubword Tokens: When BERT encounters a word that is not in its vocabulary, it uses the WordPiece tokenization to break it into subword units that are in the vocabulary. This means that even if a word is not directly known, its subcomponents likely are, allowing the model to still process and understand it.\n[UNK] Token: In cases where a word or subword cannot be tokenized into known vocabulary units, it is represented by a special token [UNK] (unknown). However, this is rare due to the effectiveness of the WordPiece tokenization\n\nEmbedding Representation\nThe maximum sentence length is 512 tokens.\nWord Embeddings: Each token in the vocabulary is represented by a 768-dimensional vector (in the case of BERT-base). This means that after tokenization, each subword token is converted into its corresponding embedding.\nPositional Embeddings: BERT also uses positional embeddings to encode the position of each token in the sequence, ensuring that the model can understand the order of words.\nSegment Embeddings: If the input consists of multiple segments (e.g., a pair of sentences), segment embeddings are used to differentiate between them.\nTransformer models, including BERT, require input sequences to be of the same length. Since text sequences can have varying lengths, shorter sequences are padded with a special token (usually [PAD]) to match the length of the longest sequence in the batch.\nVector masks help distinguish between actual data and padding. This ensures that the model does not treat padding tokens as meaningful input.\n# Input: [101, 2054, 2003, 1996, 512, 0, 0, 0]\n# Attention Mask: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nHere, 101, 2054, 2003, 1996, 512 are real tokens, and the remaining are padding tokens.\nBERT requires special tokens [CLS] at the beginning and [SEP] at the end of each input sequence. For sentence pairs, [SEP] is also used to separate the two sentences.\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer\n \n# Initialize the tokenizer\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(&#039;bert-base-uncased&#039;)\n \n# Example sentences\nsentence1 = &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;\nsentence2 = &quot;Paris is the capital of France.&quot;\n \n# Tokenize with padding and truncation\nencoding = tokenizer(\n    sentence1, sentence2,\n    add_special_tokens=True,  # Add [CLS] and [SEP]\n    max_length=20,  # Pad &amp; truncate all sentences to 20 tokens\n    padding=&#039;max_length&#039;,  # Pad to max_length\n    truncation=True,  # Truncate to max_length\n    return_tensors=&#039;pt&#039;  # Return PyTorch tensors\n)\n \n# Print the encoded inputs\nprint(&quot;Input IDs:&quot;)\nprint(encoding[&#039;input_ids&#039;])\nprint(&quot;\\nAttention Mask:&quot;)\nprint(encoding[&#039;attention_mask&#039;])\nprint(&quot;\\nToken Type IDs:&quot;)\nprint(encoding[&#039;token_type_ids&#039;])\n \nfor sent in sentences:\n    # `encode` will:\n    #   (1) Tokenize the sentence.\n    #   (2) Prepend the `[CLS]` token to the start.\n    #   (3) Append the `[SEP]` token to the end.\n    #   (4) Map tokens to their IDs.\n    encoded_sent = tokenizer.encode(\n        sent,  # Sentence to encode.\n        add_special_tokens=True,  # Add &#039;[CLS]&#039; and &#039;[SEP]&#039;\n        # This function also supports truncation and conversion\n        # to pytorch tensors, but we need to do padding, so we\n        # can&#039;t use these features :( .\n        # max_length = 128,          # Truncate all sentences.\n        # return_tensors = &#039;pt&#039;,     # Return pytorch tensors.\n    )\n    print(encoded_sent)\nTokenization\nTokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, which are then used as input for the LLM. Tokens can represent individual characters, words, or subwords.\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE):\nTraining: BPE starts with a large corpus of text and initially treats each character as a separate token. The algorithm then iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of tokens into new tokens. This process continues until a desired vocabulary size is reached.\nExample:\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a simple form of data compression that replaces the most frequent pair of adjacent bytes in a sequence with a single byte. It’s often used in text processing, particularly in natural language processing tasks.\nHow Byte Pair Encoding Works\n\nInitialization: Start with a sequence of bytes (or characters).\nCounting Pairs: Count all adjacent pairs of bytes in the sequence.\nReplace the Most Frequent Pair: Identify the most frequent pair and replace it with a new byte (a byte that doesn’t exist in the original sequence).\nRepeat: Repeat the counting and replacing process until a certain condition is met (like a maximum number of replacements).\n\nExample\nLet’s say we have the following simple sequence of characters:\nABABABA\n\nStep 1: Count Pairs\n\nThe pairs are: AB, BA, AB, BA, AB\nFrequencies:\n\nAB: 3 times\nBA: 2 times\n\n\n\nStep 2: Replace the Most Frequent Pair\n\nThe most frequent pair is AB. Let’s say we replace AB with C (a new byte).\nNew sequence: C C A\n\nStep 3: Update and Repeat\nNow, we have the sequence:\nC C A\n\n\nPairs: C C, C A\nFrequencies:\n\nC C: 1 time\nC A: 1 time\n\n\n\nNo pair is more frequent than the others, so we stop here.\n3. Pre-tokenizers:\n\nFunction: Pre-tokenizers handle spaces and punctuation before applying the main tokenizer. They can optimize the tokenization process by treating spaces as boundaries, avoiding merging tokens across spaces.\n\n4. Tokenization in Practice:\n\nVocabulary Size: The number of unique tokens determines the output dimensionality of the language model.\nHandling New Tokens: LLMs generally do not handle new tokens well. Choosing a comprehensive tokenizer and vocabulary is critical.\nChoosing the Largest Token: When applying the tokenizer, the algorithm always selects the largest available token. For instance, it would prioritize “token” over “t” if both are present in the vocabulary.\nComputational Considerations: Tokenization has computational costs. Efficient algorithms and techniques are used to speed up the process.\nFuture of Tokenizers: There’s debate about the necessity of complex tokenizers. Character-level or byte-level tokenization might become more prevalent as architectures evolve to handle longer sequences efficiently.\n\n5. Challenges with Tokenization:\n\nDomain-Specific Tokenization: Specialized domains like math and code often require custom tokenization schemes.\nImpact on Evaluation: Perplexity, a common LLM evaluation metric, is sensitive to the choice of tokenizer, making comparisons between models difficult.\n\nResources\n\nDeconstructing BERT Part 2: Visualizing the Inner Workings of Attention\nTransformers: The Architecture\nBERTViz GitHub Repository\nA Gentle Introduction to Positional Encoding in Transformer Models (Check)\nIllustrated Transformer\nTransformers Explained\nGetting Started with PyTorch 2.0 Transformers\nTutorial 14: Transformers I - Introduction\nBERT Notes\nThe Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks\nLlama3 from Scratch\nFinetuned Spam Classifier\nEcco GitHub Repository\nThe Transformers Architecture in Detail: What’s the Magic Behind LLMs\nrbcborealis.com/research-blogs/tutorial-14-transformers-i-introduction/\n\nVisualizer\n\nInspectus GitHub Repository\n"},"notes/2024/Typescript":{"title":"Typescript","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"String literal\ntypeRGBCss = rgb(${number},${number},${number}) → use template literal for excat string\ntypeguard\ninfere\nrecursion"},"notes/2024/V8-Engine":{"title":"V8 Engine","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hidden class- &gt;blog.frontend-almanac.com/js-object-structure\nmathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics\nmedium.com/@bmeurer/surprising-polymorphism-in-react-applications-63015b50abc\nblog.frontend-almanac.com/js-object-structure\nmathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics"},"notes/2024/Vector-DB":{"title":"Vector DB","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Pinecone\nChroma\nMilvus\nmilvus.io/\nQdrant\nqdrant.tech/\nweaviate\nweaviate.io/"},"notes/2024/Web-security":{"title":"Web security","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"CORS\nBefore olden days where browser allow send request from same origin to different origin with creds which is bad and they introduces CORS\n It describes a policy for how cross-origin requests can be made and used.

So fun-games.example is blocked from reading your address from your-bank.example/profile. It can also use side channels such as latency and if the request succeeded or failed to learn things.\nBut despite being incredibly annoying this doesn’t actually solve the problem!

This means that it can execute POST your-bank.example/transfer to transfer one billion dollars to their account.\nThis must be one of the biggest security compromises ever made in the name of backwards compatibility.\nThe best solution is to set up server-wide middleware that ignores implicit credentials on all cross-origin requests.

Let’s use your example to illustrate how TCP handles a missing segment:\n\n\nInitial Transmission:\n\nSender (Host A) sends TCP segments with sequence numbers 1 to 2, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, and 8 to 10.\nReceiver (Host B) successfully receives and acknowledges segments 1 to 2, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, and 8 to 10.\n\nHost A        -----&gt;   Host B\nSEQ: 1-2              ACK: 3\nSEQ: 4-6              ACK: 7\nSEQ: 6-8              ACK: 9\nSEQ: 8-10             ACK: 11\n\n\n\nMissing Segment (2 to 4):\n\nSegment with sequence numbers 2 to 4 is not received by Host B.\n\n\n\nReceiver’s Perspective:\n\nHost B detects the missing segment and sends a Duplicate ACK for the last correctly received segment (ACK: 3 in this case).\n\nHost A        &lt;-----   Host B\nSEQ: 1-2              ACK: 3 (DUP ACK)\nSEQ: 4-6\nSEQ: 6-8\nSEQ: 8-10\n\n\n\nRetransmission Triggered:\n\nHost A, upon receiving the Duplicate ACK, realizes that Host B is missing segment 2 to 4.\nHost A retransmits the missing segment (2 to 4).\n\nHost A        -----&gt;   Host B\nSEQ: 2-4              ACK: 7\n\n\n\nSubsequent Acknowledgments:\n\nHost B acknowledges the retransmitted segment (ACK: 5).\n\nHost A        &lt;-----   Host B\nSEQ: 2-4              ACK: 5\n\n\n\nNow, the TCP sender and receiver have cooperatively resolved the issue caused by the missing segment. This process demonstrates how TCP uses acknowledgments, duplicate acknowledgments, and retransmissions to recover from packet loss and ensure the reliable delivery of data.\nMTU link layer → Maximum Transmission Unit  maximum size of an IP packet that can be sent over a link\nFragmentation is allowed by MTU. If a packet is larger than the MTU, it is split up into smaller parts.\nMTU is set on each router when the packet come big then that it will do fragmentation\nMSS stands for Maximum Segment Size. It is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a single TCP segment.\nThe Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Maximum Segment Size (MSS) defines the maximum amount of data that a host accepts in a single TCP/IPv4 datagram.\nThis TCP/IPv4 datagram is possibly fragmented at the IPv4 layer. The MSS value is sent as a TCP header option only in TCP SYN segments.\nEach side of a TCP connection reports its MSS value to the other side. The MSS value is not negotiated between hosts.\nA TCP option called MSS is negotiated as part of the handshake. The IP header and the TCP header are not included.\nMax can be 1460\nTCP SACK (Selective Acknowledgment)\nSelective Acknowledgment (SACK) allows a receiver to acknowledge non-contiguous blocks of data. This helps in efficiently managing data loss and retransmissions.\nExample Scenario\n\n\nInitial Transmission:\n\nData Sent:\n\nSegment 1-100\nSegment 100-200\nSegment 200-300\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue:\n\nAssume the client did not receive Segment 100-200.\n\n\n\nClient Behavior:\n\nAcknowledgment (ACK): The client sends an ACK for the last successfully received segment, which is 100.\nSACK Option: The SACK option will indicate that the client received data up to 100 and is missing data in the range 100-200.\nSACK Block: The SACK block specifies:\n\nLeft Edge: 100 (starting point of the missing data)\nRight Edge: 200 (end point of the missing data)\n\n\n\nClient&#039;s ACK: 100\nSACK Block: [100, 200)\n\n\n\nServer Action:\n\nUpon receiving the SACK block, the server understands that Segment 100-200 is missing and needs retransmission.\n\n\n\n\nFilters\nFilters in Wireshark help isolate and analyze specific packets or types of traffic. Here are some useful filters:\n\n\nRetransmissions, Duplicates, and Window Updates:\n\nFilter: tcp.analysis.flags &amp;&amp; !tcp.analysis.window_update\nPurpose: Lists all retransmitted TCP packets, duplicate acknowledgments, and window update packets.\n\n\n\nTCP Reset Packets:\n\nFilter: tcp.flags.reset\nPurpose: Shows packets where the server has reset the connection, indicating that the server is not listening on the port.\n\n\n\nHTTP Response Time:\n\nFilter: http.time &gt; 0.25\nPurpose: Lists HTTP responses that take longer than 25 milliseconds to process.\n\n\n\nTLS 1.2 Handshake\nIt takes 4 steps to complete the handshake before sending the first encrypted request from a browser:\n\nClient Hello\nServer Hello\nClient key exchange and generate the master secret\nFinished\n\ncabulous.medium.com/tls-1-2-andtls-1-3-handshake-walkthrough-4cfd0a798164\n\nHTPP2\ncabulous.medium.com/http-2-and-how-it-works-9f645458e4b2\nSSL/TLS session keys and the server’s private key serve different purposes in the context of secure communication over the internet.\n1\nSS0\ntshark -r &#039;el (1).cap&#039; -Y &quot;tcp.flags.syn == 1 &amp;&amp; tcp.flags.ack == 0&quot; -T fields -e ip.dst | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr \ntshark -r &#039;el (1).cap&#039; -Y &quot;tcp.flags.syn == 1 &amp;&amp; tcp.flags.ack == 0&quot; -T fields -e eth.dst | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\nFinding SYN Packets Not Followed by SYN+ACK\n1. Apply Display Filter\n\nFilter: Use the display filter tcp.flags eq 0x02 to show only packets where the SYN flag is set.\n\nThis filter isolates SYN packets, which are the initial packets in the TCP handshake.\n\n\n\n2. Analyze Conversations\n\nNavigate to Conversations:\n\nGo to Statistics → Conversations in the Wireshark menu.\n\n\nApply Filter to Conversations:\n\nAt the bottom of the Conversations window, check the option “Limit to display filter”. This ensures that only the filtered packets (SYN packets) are considered in the analysis.\n\n\nSelect the TCP Tab:\n\nClick on the TCP tab to view only TCP conversations.\n\n\nSort by Packet Count:\n\nClick on the “Packets” column header to sort the conversations by the number of packets.\n\n\n\n3. Identify Connection Types\n\nConnections with 1 Packet:\n\nThese are likely “good” connections where only a single SYN packet was sent. This could indicate that the connection was successfully established or that no response was received but no retries were made.\n\n\nConnections with More Than 1 Packet:\n\nThese are most likely “unanswered” connections where the SYN packet was retried multiple times due to no SYN+ACK response. The presence of multiple packets typically indicates retries.\n\n\n"},"post/2023/helloworld":{"title":"helloworld","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hi, I’m K.Boopathi! 👋\nAbout Me\nI’m a passionate programmer with an insatiable curiosity for exploring diverse technologies and leveraging them to create cutting-edge products.

To my relief, the output was zero—no unauthorized login attempts. But my curiosity was piqued. I delved deeper into journalctl, discovering a command to display all Systemd logs with process IDs:\njournalctl -f -o verbose\nUpon executing the query on our VM, I encountered an intriguing error that immediately captured my attention.\n MESSAGE=/etc/.httpd/.../httpd: line 43: pnscan: command not found\n\n“Pnscan?” I muttered to myself, furrowing my brows. A quick Google search revealed that “pnscan” is a tool for scanning network ports—a tool we certainly hadn’t authorized on our VM.\nDetermined to unravel this mystery, I extracted the process ID from the journalctl logs and ventured into the depths of the /proc directory. Inside the PID folder, I hoped to glean more insights into this rogue process.\nMy first stop was the cmdline file, where I discovered the command that initiated the process\n `/bin/bash/etc/.httpd/.../httpd`\n\nIt seemed innocuous enough—a command to run the Apache server.

My friends, who didn’t really know much about computers, seemed like the perfect targets for a harmless prank. They were excited but didn’t have a clue about the technical stuff I was up to. I saw an opportunity to have a little fun, knowing they’d fall for it because they didn’t know much about programming.\nThe Master Plan\nI wanted to play a trick on my friends to show them how powerful C programming is. But it was all just a joke! Here’s how I did it:\nCreating the Fake Program: I wrote a simple C program that looked like a Facebook login tool. But it was just a trick. The program would ask for their Facebook username and password, and then say “Facebook is down”!\nPlaying the Prank: I ran the program in front of my friends, and they typed in their phone numbers and passwords. I acted like I was trying to fix the problem, but I was really trying not to laugh.\nThe Big Reveal: After my friends left, I opened the file where I had saved their login information. I used it to log into their Facebook accounts and change their profile pictures to something really embarrassing and funny. Even I couldn’t help but laugh!”\nThe Program\nHere’s the mischievous code I used for the prank. Disclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only!\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n \nint main() {\n    char phoneNumber[50];\n    char password[50];\n    FILE *file;\n \n    // Open the file to store credentials\n    file = fopen(&quot;credentials.txt&quot;, &quot;a&quot;);\n    if (file == NULL) {\n        printf(&quot;Error opening file!\\n&quot;);\n        return 1;\n    }\n \n    // Ask for user details\n    printf(&quot;Welcome to the Facebook Login Tool!\\n&quot;);\n    printf(&quot;Please enter your phone number: &quot;);\n    fgets(phoneNumber, 50, stdin);\n    printf(&quot;Please enter your password: &quot;);\n    fgets(password, 50, stdin);\n \n    // Store the credentials in a file\n    fprintf(file, &quot;Phone Number: %s&quot;, phoneNumber);\n    fprintf(file, &quot;Password: %s&quot;, password);\n \n    // Close the file\n    fclose(file);\n \n    // Display a fake error message\n    printf(&quot;Unable to reach Facebook at the moment. Please try again later.\\n&quot;);\n \n    return 0;\n}\n \nWhat Happened Next\nThe next day, my friends came to college and told me that their Facebook profiles had been changed to show them in silly costumes or funny pictures. They were shocked and little scared.\nThey told me that their accounts had been hacked. But after some fun and teasing, I finally told them the truth - that I was the one who had done it as a prank. We all had a good laugh together and the fun came to an end.\nThe Lesson\nHere’s the important part: don’t do this at home. While my prank was just for fun, playing with people’s personal information is not okay. It’s important to respect people’s privacy and use your coding skills in a good way.\nThe Main Point\nIf you want to play a prank, make sure it’s harmless and makes everyone smile. Use your coding skills for good things and keep your pranks light-hearted. Remember, there’s a line between being funny and being mean online.\nHappy coding, and may your pranks be fun and harmless!"},"post/2024/Code-Against-the-Clock--From-Clicks-to-Cash":{"title":"Code Against the Clock  From Clicks to Cash","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome back to “Code Against the Clock!” blog series where I’ll reveal how I turned my most boring tasks into streamlined, time-saving machines.

Let’s dive in and get your tasks on autopilot!\nMy Unexpected Online Hustle\nLet’s rewind to my college days. I was on a quest to find ways to earn some extra cash online while learning something new. During my research, I stumbled upon a service called Sbitly. The concept was intriguing: it’s a URL shortening platform where you paste a long link, and it gives you a shortened version. The twist? When people click on these shortened links, they first see an ad before being redirected to the original site. You get paid for each click, and it seemed like a neat way to earn money.\nI thought, “Why not automate this process?” With a bit of Python and Selenium magic, I set out to streamline this task and see how far I could take it.\nThe Automation Project:\nHere’s a peek into how I tackled this project:\n1. Tools of the Trade:\n\nPython: Chosen for its simplicity and versatility. It’s a powerhouse for scripting and automation.\nSelenium: The go-to tool for web automation. It allows you to control a web browser programmatically, making it perfect for interacting with web interfaces.\n\n2. The Plan:\n\n\nScraping Tech Blogs: I wanted to gather a list of tech blog URLs to shorten. Sites like House of Bots, Fossbytes, and The Hacker News were my targets. For this, I used Python’s BeautifulSoup library to scrape these sites for interesting blog links.\n\n\nShortening URLs: Using Selenium, I automated the process of visiting Sbitly, pasting the URLs, and retrieving shortened links.\n\n\nSharing on Facebook: Finally, I needed to share these shortened URLs on Facebook and in Facebook groups. Again, Selenium was used to automate the posting process, ensuring that all the links were shared efficiently.\n\n\nNote: As of now, the Sbitly website is no longer active. The automation techniques and code examples shared here are based on my experience with the platform while it was operational.\nYou can find the code for this project here and watch a demo video here.\nYour Turn!\nHave you ever automated a task using code?

Today, I’m excited to share a project where I turned a repetitive, manual chore into an automated powerhouse. Ready to see how you can save time and add a touch of excitement to your workflow? Let’s dive in!\nThe Backstory\nWorking at a startup has its perks – like the chance to collaborate with various departments and uncover inefficiencies ripe for automation. During a recent chat with our marketing team, I discovered a task that was just begging for a tech upgrade. They were manually:\n\nVisiting Product Hunt daily to get the top 5 products of the day.\nGathering social media details for each product maker.\nRepeating this process every day.\n\nAs soon as I heard this, I thought, “Why not automate it?” I grabbed my laptop and started coding.\nThe Problem Breakdown\nTo tackle this, I needed to build a scraper. Here’s a quick rundown of the approach I took:\n\n\nUnderstanding Product Hunt’s Structure: I investigated how Product Hunt renders its content and the APIs they use. They rely on server-side rendering for displaying the top products and detailed information.\n\n\nChoosing the Tools: Since the website uses server-side rendering, I decided to use Puppeteer with Node.js. Puppeteer allows us to control a headless browser and scrape content as if we were browsing manually.\n\n\nFetching Data:\n\nTop 5 Products: I started by scraping the Product Hunt website to get the top 5 products of the day.\nProduct Details: For each product, I clicked through to get the product ID.\nMaker Information: Using the product ID, I accessed an API to fetch details about the product maker.\nSocial Media Details: With the maker IDs in hand, I visited each user’s profile page via Puppeteer and scraped their social media details.\nData Storage: Finally, I compiled all this information into a CSV file, making it easy for the marketing team to work with.\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nAutomating these tasks not only saves time but also reduces human error and ensures that the marketing team always has the latest data at their fingertips. Plus, it’s a great example of how technology can streamline repetitive tasks and add value.\nNote: If you want the source code feel free to ping me :)\nYour Turn!\nHave you ever automated a task using code?

Today, I’m thrilled to share a project where I turned a repetitive, manual chore into an automated powerhouse. Ready to see how you can save time and add a touch of excitement to your workflow? Let’s dive in!\nThe Backstory\nAs many of you know, I work as a full-stack developer at a startup. We use Keka for managing employee attendance, which requires manually clocking in and out each day when entering and leaving the office. The issue? Sometimes, I forget to clock in or out, which results in my attendance being marked as not present. This means I have to raise a ticket in Keka to correct it – a tedious task that I wanted to automate.\nThe Problem Breakdown\nInitially, I looked for an API provided by Keka for this purpose, but unfortunately, they don’t offer one. No problem! As a developer, I took on the challenge of solving this myself. I started by analyzing Keka’s website to understand how it works. Using the network tab in my browser’s developer tools, I identified the endpoint triggered when clocking in and out.\nI wrote a simple Node.js script using fetch to make requests with a Bearer token in the header, and it worked. However, there was a catch: the Bearer token expired daily. I discovered that the website retained the refresh token in local storage, which was used to obtain a new Bearer token when the old one expired.\nAfter adapting my script to handle this, I faced a few more challenges:\n\nHow would the script know when I entered the office?\nHow would it determine when to clock out?\nHow would I be notified of any errors and be able to manually clock in?\n\nThe Solution\nTo tackle these issues, I devised the following solutions:\n\nOffice Entry Detection: I configured the script with specific office hours. The script would then start attempting to clock in when these hours were reached.\nClock-Out Timing: I set a configurable duration in the script for how many hours after clocking in it should automatically clock out.\nError Notification and Manual Clock-In: I integrated Slack notifications into the script. This way, I would receive alerts for successful clock-ins and outs, as well as errors.\n\n[CRON Job (Every 15 minutes)] ---&gt; [Node.js Script]\n                         \\-------&gt; [Check Time] ---&gt; [Clock In/Out]\n                         \\-------&gt; [Notify (Slack)]\n\nOnce everything was in place, I scheduled a cron job to run my script every 15 minutes. This setup worked flawlessly for a year, automating my attendance management efficiently.\nTransition to a Chrome Extension\nAfter a year, I decided to enhance the solution by converting the script into a Chrome extension. This made it easier to share with colleagues. Here’s how the extension works:\n\nSetup: After installing the extension, you’re prompted to enter your office in and out times and specify the duration after which you want to clock out.\nAlarm Mechanism: The extension sets a Chrome alarm to run every 15 minutes. When the clock-in time is reached, it opens the Keka website with a query parameter (?CLK_IN=true).\nContent Script: The extension includes a content script that parses the query parameters and triggers the clock-in or clock-out process. Once successful, it sends a success message to the background service, which records the clock-in time and schedules the clock-out accordingly.\n\n[User Setup (Times &amp; Duration)] ---&gt; [Chrome Extension]\n                                    |   \\--&gt; [Alarm Mechanism]\n                                    |   \\--&gt; [Content Script]\n                                    \\--&gt; [Keka Website]\n\nThis streamlined approach made managing my attendance even easier!\nNote: If you’re interested in the source code, feel free to reach out to me!\nYour Turn!\nHave you ever automated a task using code?

However, when I entered my final year, I found it challenging to dedicate time to posting videos regularly. I didn’t want my channel to stagnate, so I decided to automate video creation.\nThe Idea\nMy initial idea was to create videos featuring code writing with background music, requiring minimal human intervention. Then, I thought, why not create animations or cartoons using HTML and CSS, and add background music? You can check out one of my videos here which make use of automation.\nThe Challenge\nI initially planned to use Python’s PyAutoGUI library in laptop, but I realized it would be more challenging than I anticipated. So, I decided to learn about automating Android apps and discovered the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device.\nBreaking Down the Problem\nI chose to work with ADB and found a Python library ppadb  that helps interact with it. I came up with an algorithm that would guide my script’s logic:\nThe Algorithm\nStep 1: Initialize Android Device Connection\nTo start, I need to establish a connection to the Android device using the ppadb library. This will allow me to set up the device for automation and perform subsequent actions.\nStep 2: Write HTML Code\nNext, I need to write HTML code to the Android device’s web page editor. I’ll create a string containing the HTML code and use the writeHTML function to send it to the device.\nStep 3: Write CSS Code\nAfter that, I need to write CSS code to the Android device’s CSS editor. I’ll split the CSS code into individual styles using the splitme separator and write each style to the device using the writeCss function.\nStep 4: Write JavaScript Code\nThen, I need to write JavaScript code to the Android device’s JavaScript editor. I’ll create a string containing the JavaScript code and use the writeJs function to send it to the device (although this functionality is not implemented in this code).\nStep 5: Start Video Recording\nNext, I need to start a video recording on the Android device using the videoStart function. This will capture the device’s screen activity.\nStep 6: Wait for Animations to Complete\nAfter starting the video recording, I need to wait for a specified amount of time (5 seconds in this code) to allow any animations to complete.\nStep 7: Stop Video Recording\nOnce the animations have completed, I need to stop the video recording on the Android device using the videoStop function.\nStep 8: Retrieve Video from Android Device\nThen, I need to retrieve the recorded video from the Android device using the getVideoToSys function.\nStep 9: Process Video\nAfter retrieving the video, I need to process it using the editVideo function which will run a javascript program as subprocess in python and the javascript use fluent-ffmpeg lib to add backgrround music to the video\nStep 10: Upload Video to Android Device\nFinally, I need to upload the processed video back to the Android device using the putVideoToMobile function.\nAfter following the steps outlined in the algorithm, I was able to automate the creation of YouTube Shorts with impressive results. The automation process not only streamlined content creation but also ensured a consistent quality across videos. The background music and animations added a professional touch, making the content engaging and visually appealing.\nNote: If you want the source code feel free to ping me :)\nYour Turn!\nHave you ever automated a task using code?

Let’s dive in and get your tasks on autopilot!\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic: A Turning Point\nWho can forget the sudden halt in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill? Schools and colleges closed, and virtual classes became the new norm. As a college student, I was expected to attend online classes, but I had other commitments that couldn’t be ignored. My family needed my assistance during the lockdown, and spending hours staring at a computer screen wasn’t an option.\nThat’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I had recently started learning Node.js, and I saw an opportunity to use my newfound skills to automate my virtual classes. Why not, right? I was already spending hours writing code, so why not write it in a way that would do all the class attendance for me?\nDiscovering Puppeteer\nDuring my research, I stumbled upon Puppeteer, a powerful tool that can be used with Node.js to automate browser functions. It was the perfect solution for my problem, as I could create a script that would launch a browser, log into my online classroom portal, and attend classes on my behalf.\nBreaking Down the Problem\nBefore I started coding, I needed to break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. I came up with an algorithm that would guide my script’s logic:\nThe Algorithm\n\nFind Present Class: Identify the current class schedule and find the next class to attend.\nStart Browser: Launch a new browser instance using Puppeteer.\nLogin: Determine the login method: use stored cookies to authenticate or sign in with Google.\nOpen Class: Navigate to the online class platform and join the class.\nCheck Number of Students: Verify the number of students in the class. If the student count is greater than a configured count, join the class.\nLeave Class (if necessary): If there are no students in the class, leave the class.\nFind Next Class Time and Join: Schedule the next class attendance based on the class schedule.\nRestart: Repeat the process for the next class.\n\nThe Result\nIt took me just a day to complete the project, and I started using it for my online classes. The feeling of automating a tedious task was incredibly empowering!\nYou can find the code here"},"post/2024/Code-Against-the-Clock-How-I-Enhanced-My-PM-Productivity":{"title":"Code Against the Clock How I Enhanced My PM Productivity","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome back to “Code Against the Clock!” blog series where I’ll reveal how I turned my most boring tasks into streamlined, time-saving machines.

Let’s dive in and get your tasks on autopilot!\nThe backstory\nEver felt like managing sub-tasks in Jira was like trying to juggle flaming torches? 😅 In our bustling startup, we work in two-week sprints, and every Jira task often spawns a bunch of smaller sub-tasks. Keeping track of these can get pretty monotonous, and it’s not exactly the highlight of our day.\nThe Sprint Close Dilemma\nHere’s the kicker: At the end of each sprint, when our Project Manager (PM) tries to mark the sprint as complete, Jira throws a fit if there are unfinished sub-tasks. It demands that every single sub-task be closed before the sprint can be completed. Imagine the PM’s frustration—either they have to manually close each sub-task or hunt down developers to update their statuses. This can drag on forever and pull them away from more strategic work.\nMy Automation Adventure\nDetermined to rescue our PM from this repetitive grind, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into scripting. Here’s how I transformed a mundane task into a streamlined solution:\n\nCrafting a Command Line Superhero: I designed a command line tool that’s like a magic wand for our PM. It simplifies the process of closing sub-tasks and lets the PM select the sprint they’re working with.\nSub-Task Closure on Autopilot: This tool works like a charm—it automatically identifies completed tasks and updates all their sub-tasks to “completed” status. No more manual updates or endless status-chasing!\nBoosting Efficiency: Thanks to this automation, our PM now breezes through sprint closures. The tool does the heavy lifting quickly and accurately, freeing up time and reducing errors.\n\nThe Payoff\nThe impact has been fantastic! Our PM’s workload has lightened, task management is spot-on, and they can now focus on more strategic, high-impact work. It’s like turning a mountain of paperwork into a molehill!\nCurious About the Code?\nIf you’re itching to see the source code or have any questions, just give me a shout!\nYour Turn!\nHave you ever automated a task to save time?

Let’s dive in and get your tasks on autopilot!\nThe backstory\nEver felt like reviewing sprint data was just a never-ending task of managing spreadsheets? I sure did. At our Agile startup, we were swamped with tasks, metrics, and status updates. Keeping track of everything started to feel like wading through an endless sea of data.\nBut here’s the good part: I found a way to make it easier, thanks to a bit of scripting.\nThe Problem: Sprint Retrospectives Were a Chore\nDuring our sprints, we obsessively track tasks. We look at task histories, measure how long each task took, and watch for status changes. While this is important for understanding performance, it often became a tedious and time-consuming process that left us more drained than informed.\nThe Solution: Meet Our New Command Line Hero\nI decided enough was enough. With my trusty scripting skills, I set out to automate the whole process. Here’s how I turned a dreaded task into a streamlined, efficient process:\n\n\nCommand Line Tool Development: I created a command line tool designed to be the ultimate sidekick for our Scrum Master. It automates the extraction and analysis of task data, making our retrospectives smoother and more insightful.\n\n\nCrunching the Numbers: This tool doesn’t just pull data; it dives deep. It fetches all tasks from the sprint, sifts through their history logs, and calculates essential metrics like development time, testing time, and status changes. These insights are like a treasure map, guiding us to understand our sprint’s performance and uncover areas for improvement.\n\n\nSeamless Data Export: Once the calculations are done, the data is exported as a CSV file. This file can be easily imported into Google Sheets or any other analysis tool, letting our Scrum Master whip up comprehensive reports in minutes. Goodbye, manual data compilation!\n\n\nThe Impact: Efficiency Unleashed\nThanks to this automation, our Scrum Master now generates detailed task reports in mere minutes. Not only does this save us hours, but it also sharpens the accuracy of our sprint evaluations.\nWant to See the Magic?\nCurious about how it all works?

As classes shifted online and social media became a black hole of endless scrolling, I decided to use this time productively. My choice? To dive into the MERN stack, a powerful web development suite consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.\nFrom Idea to Reality\nEager to apply what I was learning, I wanted to build something meaningful. That’s when inspiration struck: an IP Logger. The concept was simple but intriguing. Users could sign up, log in, and generate a unique link from any URL. Clicking this link would capture the visitor’s IP address and details before redirecting them to the original URL. It promised to be a handy tool for gaining insights into link clicks.\nFueled by excitement, I spent two intense days coding non-stop. Watching my ideas materialize into lines of code was thrilling. Once completed, I hosted the project and made it accessible for anyone to try. I also uploaded the code to GitHub for public viewing and potential contributions. You can check out the project here.\nA Surprise Notification\nWeeks later, while juggling other commitments, a GitHub notification caught my eye. A stranger had opened an issue on my project, requesting a feature to record the time and date of link clicks. It was a small request but a huge motivator someone found my project useful enough to suggest an improvement!\nCurious and eager to assist, I reached out to this user. We began chatting on Telegram, where he revealed that he had no experience with the MERN stack but was impressed by the IP Logger. After our discussion, I added the requested feature, enhancing the tool’s functionality.\nFrom Coding to Cash\nThe user was thrilled with the update and requested further help with hosting the project on his virtual machine. Hosting a MERN stack project can be daunting for beginners, so I guided him through the setup and deployment process. Once the project was up and running smoothly, he offered me $100 for my assistance.\nThis unexpected reward was more than just financial—it was a validation of my skills and a tangible proof that my college learning could make a real-world impact. It was a gratifying moment that marked my first earnings from a personal project.\nThe Takeaway\nThis experience highlighted the value of practical skills and the importance of sharing your work with the world. You never know who might find it useful or what opportunities it might bring. For me, it was the beginning of a new chapter, proving that even during challenging times, creativity and dedication can lead to meaningful achievements."},"post/2024/How-I-Hacked-a-Company-Recruitment-Test-The-Unexpected-Tech-Adventure-of-My-College-Life":{"title":"How I Hacked a Company Recruitment Test The Unexpected Tech Adventure of My College Life","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Ah, college life! The thrill of final year comes with the excitement of job placements. We all know the drill: companies come to campus, conduct aptitude tests, coding challenges, and sometimes, we get to showcase our skills in a high-stakes interview. But what if I told you that one of those tests turned into an unexpected adventure involving a bit of hacking? Buckle up as I share how I turned a routine exam into an impromptu tech experiment—and how it all unfolded.\nThe Recruitment Challenge\nIn our final year, our college arranged several companies to visit for recruitment. Most of them conducted their tests on paper, but one company decided to go digital. They sent us an online exam link with login credentials. The test consisted of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and coding problems.\nAs usual, we were all set to tackle the test. However, my curiosity got the better of me. Instead of focusing solely on the questions, I started exploring the technical side of the exam. I wondered how the website was fetching questions and submitting answers.\nThe Discovery\nWhile everyone else was busy answering questions, I began to investigate the website. I noticed a pattern in the URLs used to fetch the questions: http://companyDomain.in/ConductTestApplication/test/getQuestions/[1-100]. The numbers in the URL represented question numbers, and the server responded with the questions in JSON format.\nIntrigued, I realized there was no authentication required to access this endpoint. So, I decided to test it out. I copied the URL and opened it in incognito mode. Lo and behold, I got a response with all the questions.\nThe Script\nAfter the exam, back at home, I couldn’t resist the urge to see where this would lead. I wrote a script to fetch all the questions from the website. With the questions in hand, I created a static webpage displaying them and hosted it online. I shared the link with a few friends just for fun.\nThe Ethical Dilemma\nLooking back, I realize that what I did wasn’t the most ethical thing. Hacking into a test and sharing it with friends wasn’t exactly in line with good conduct. But, I have to admit, it was an exhilarating experience that taught me a lot about web security and curiosity-driven problem solving.\nConclusion\nSo, there you have it how a routine college recruitment test turned into a hacking adventure. It was a mix of curiosity, technical skill, and a dash of mischief. While I don’t endorse unethical practices, this experience was a memorable chapter of my college life and a valuable lesson in the world of cybersecurity."},"post/2024/How-to-capture-mongodb-protocol-in--wireshark":{"title":"How to capture mongodb protocol in  wireshark","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/tmp/tlskey.log\nRun a nodejs program as node --tls-keylog=/tmp/tlskey index.js where the tls key will be stored on that path and add this tlskey path to wire shark to decrypt the msg by doing following\nGo to Preferences→Protocols→TLS and edit the path as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nMongodb uses Mongodb wire protocol at application level to know more check here"},"post/2024/Hunting-the-Hacker-A-Deep-Dive-into-Courier-Fraud":{"title":"Hunting the Hacker A Deep Dive into Courier Fraud","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"In today’s digital age, cyber scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Recently, one of our colleagues received a suspicious call that led to an attempted scam. This blog post details our investigation into the scam, revealing the techniques used by the fraudsters and how we managed to thwart their efforts.\nThe Call\nIt all began when one of our colleagues received a phone call from someone claiming to be from a courier company. They were told that our college had an courier to be delivered, but to complete the delivery, a payment of ₹6 was required. The caller insisted on sending an APK file via WhatsApp, which needed to be installed to make the payment.\nThe APK\nSuspicious of the request, our colleague forwarded the APK to me, knowing my expertise in software development and cybersecurity. My investigation began by downloading and extracting the contents of the APK. Inside, I found several dex files, which I knew contained the app’s compiled source code. Using a tool called jadx, (jadx -d outputDirName extractedapkfile) I decompiled the APK to inspect its source code.\nThe Investigation\nAs I delved into the code, I searched for URLs that might indicate where the app was communicating. I discovered a domain:parceltracing.com. Visiting the website, I found it appeared to be a legitimate parcel tracking service with a professional landing page.\nContinuing my investigation, I found a suspicious line of code: this.webView.loadUrl(&quot;file:///android_asset/index.html&quot;);. This indicated that the app was loading a local HTML file. I examined the contents of index.html and found two images of parcels and a form requesting an address and payment amount. Clicking ‘Next’ on the form led to another page asking for UPI payment details, including phone number, bank name, and UPI ID.\nThe Scam Unveiled\nThe final piece of the puzzle was found in the source code of the payment page. It showed that the form was sending a payload containing the UPI ID and other details to a server at sonuv.parceltracing.com/%24Gh3_%402%26E*(b%5E%409%23L6K%40/success.php. This was how the scammers were attempting to steal UPI IDs and potentially siphon money from unsuspecting victims.\nThe Counterattack\nArmed with this information, I decided to take action to protect others from falling victim to this scam. I wrote a script to flood the scammer’s server with random names, UPI IDs, and other details, effectively filling their database with junk data. This not only rendered their current scam attempt useless but also disrupted their operations, preventing them from cheating others."},"post/2024/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Case-of-the-Content-Length-Mismatch":{"title":"Sherlock Holmes The Case of the Content Length Mismatch","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to our Sherlock Holmes-inspired tech adventure Series! Imagine each technical challenge as a thrilling mystery waiting to be solved. Like Sherlock Holmes with his sharp eye for detail, I’ll tackle the problem with wit and precision. Let’s dive in and crack these cases together!\nRunning a website smoothly is akin to maintaining a finely-tuned machine. Yet, like any mystery tale, unexpected twists can disrupt the flow. Recently, our team faced a perplexing error while serving our website: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH in Chrome. Join us as we unravel this digital whodunit and uncover how we cracked the case, restoring our site’s seamless operation.\nInitial Clues\nIt all started with user reports of intermittent loading issues on our website. I  quickly jumped into action, opening Chrome’s developer console to gather more clues. There it was, staring back at me: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH. This error suggested that the content length specified in the response header did not match the actual length of the content served. But why?\nConsidering the Usual Suspects\nWith the error in hand, we began to consider the usual suspects:\n\nNetwork issues\nCorrupt files\nWeb server misconfiguration\n\nHowever, these avenues didn’t yield any conclusive evidence. It was time to dig deeper.\nDelving Deeper\nI started my investigation by inspecting the code environment to ensure everything was built correctly. This involved verifying that all files were generated and deployed as expected, and checking for any build errors or warnings that could indicate an issue. The real breakthrough came when I compared the file content in the code environment with the content received by the browser. It was clear that half the file content was missing, pointing to an issue during the file serving process.\nZeroing in on Nginx\nGiven that we use Nginx to serve our content, I suspected it might be the culprit. I logged into the Nginx server to perform basic checks, ensuring all configurations were in order and there were no obvious errors in the logs. Everything appeared normal at first glance, but the problem persisted.\nDetermined to dig deeper, I did some research on the specific error Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH in relation to Nginx. During my search, I stumbled upon a Stack Overflow thread that suggested turning off proxy_buffering by adding proxy_buffering off; to the Nginx configuration.\nA Major Breakthrough\nDisabling buffering in Nginx seemed like a long shot, but I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, it worked! The error disappeared, and the website began loading correctly. However, I wanted to understand why this change had resolved the issue.\nUnderstanding Proxy Buffering\nDelving into the role of proxy buffering, I discovered that when buffering is enabled, Nginx receives the response from the proxied server as quickly as possible, saving it into the buffers set by the proxy_buffer_size and proxy_buffers directives. If the entire response doesn’t fit into memory, a portion of it can be saved to a temporary file on the disk. Disabling buffering makes Nginx pass the response to the client synchronously, immediately as it is received, without trying to read the whole response first.\nUncovering the Root Cause\nThis information led me to investigate the disk usage on our VM. Upon checking, I found that the Nginx server’s disk was 100% full. This was a significant clue. I dug further to identify what was consuming all the disk space and discovered that a recently added system service script for internal purpose which have logging enabled and caused the disk to fill up.\nThe Final Resolution\nTo resolve the issue, I took the following steps:\n\nStopping the Logging Service: I immediately stopped the logging service to prevent further log accumulation.\nClearing Old Logs: I cleared the old logs to free up disk space.\nRe-enabling Proxy Buffering: With the disk space issue resolved, I reverted the proxy_buffering setting to its original state.\n\nWith these actions, our website was back to normal, loading smoothly without any errors.\nStay tuned for the next adventure in our Sherlock Holmes series, where we continue to unearth and solve the mysteries."},"post/2024/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Case-of-the-Missing-User-IPs":{"title":"Sherlock Holmes The Case of the Missing User IPs","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to our series of infrastructure detective stories, where we unravel the mysteries lurking within our systems In this episode, we tackle a perplexing problem: our Nginx server inside Kubernetes was logging an IP address that didn’t match the actual user IP. Join me as we unravel the mystery and uncover the truth behind the missing IP.\nThe Mysterious IP\nIt all started when we noticed something unusual in our logs. The IP addresses recorded by Nginx were not matching the actual IPs of our users. Every log entry showed the same IP, regardless of the user. Clearly, something was amiss. The first clue led us to believe that a proxy was involved, obscuring the true origin of the requests.\nThe Proxy Puzzle\nDetermined to get to the bottom of this, I decided to log the X-Forwarded-For header, hoping it would reveal the original IP. However, to my surprise, the header was empty. This deepened the mystery. What could be interfering with our ability to see the user IPs?\nThe Gateway Revelation\nNext, I examined the IP that was consistently logged. It turned out to be an address ending with “.1”, which matched the default gateway of our Nginx service. This pointed the investigation towards Kubernetes. There was something about the Kubernetes configuration that was hidding the user ip.\nKubernetes Configuration Conundrum\nDigging into the Kubernetes documentation, I discovered that our nginx service’s externalTrafficPolicy was set to Cluster. By default, Kubernetes balances the load among different Nginx pods, proxying requests and masking the original IP. This explained why the user IPs were not appearing in our logs.\nThe Final Piece\nTo solve the problem, I changed the externalTrafficPolicy to Local. This configuration ensures that all requests are sent directly to the pods without being proxied by Kubernetes. While this meant giving up on load balancing, it allowed us to log the true user IPs.\nWith the mystery solved, our logs now accurately reflect the IP addresses of our users. This journey through the depths of Kubernetes and Nginx configurations highlights the importance of understanding the tools we use and their impact on our systems. Stay tuned for the next adventure, where we continue to uncover and solve the hidden challenges in our infrastructure."},"post/2024/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Great-Lambda-Mystery":{"title":"Sherlock Holmes The Great Lambda Mystery","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to our Sherlock Holmes-inspired tech adventure Series!

Let’s dive in and crack these cases together!\nThe Early Morning Disturbance\nIt was 4 o’clock in the morning when I received an urgent call from a colleague. Our Lambda function had suddenly stopped working. Groggy but alert, I sprang into action, ready to tackle the issue head-on. The error logs pointed me to a peculiar message: npm ERR! rofs EROFS: read-only file system, mkdir &#039;/home/sbx_user1051&#039;.\nThe First Clue: Read-Only File System\nThe error message was clear: npm was attempting to write to a read-only file system. But why was this happening all of a sudden? My first step was to examine our recent code changes. Had we inadvertently introduced code that attempted to write to the disk? A thorough review revealed no such changes.\nThe Google Search: A Trail of Breadcrumbs\nWith no immediate answers in the code, I turned to the vast expanse of the internet. After some diligent searching, I stumbled upon a Stack Overflow answer suggesting to set the environment variable NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/.npm. Intrigued, I applied the suggested fix. To my relief, it worked. The Lambda function sprang back to life, and I could finally breathe easy.\nThe Curious Case of the Environment Variable\nBut why did this environment variable fix the issue? My curiosity was piqued, and I spent the next two hours delving into the depths of npm documentation and GitHub repositories. I discovered that starting with npm 8, a change in the @npmcli/run-script module caused scripts to be written into the temporary directory (tmpdir()) of the user path (/home/sbx_user1051). This information was confirmed in the npm CI repository’s issue tab\nThe Final Piece of the Puzzle\nWe now understood how setting NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/.npm resolved the issue. However, one question remained: why did this problem arise so suddenly? More research revealed the answer. AWS Lambda had deprecated Node.js 14 and automatically upgraded our environment to the latest version, which included npm 8. This upgrade introduced the change that caused our issue.\nStay tuned for our next adventure, where we continue to unravel the mysteries of the infrastructure world, one case at a time.

Imagine each technical challenge as a thrilling mystery waiting to be solved. Just like Sherlock, we’ll tackle these problems with sharp attention to detail. Grab a cup of coffee, and let’s dive in!\nThe Case Begins: DDoS and Brute Force Attacks\nIt was a fine day until disaster struck. We received alerts about DDoS and brute force attacks from random bot IPs. Our team sprang into action to mitigate the attacks. But just when we thought we had things under control, another alarming message popped up: our Redis database was at 80% capacity! This was shocking, especially since our Redis DB usually stays under 20MB.\nInvestigation Phase: The Redis Mystery\nBefore diving into the Redis issue, we focused on stopping the DDoS and brute force attacks. We implemented rate limiting for specific endpoints using Cloudflare.\nNow, let’s explore what we store in Redis. We use it for user session management in our Node.js application, utilizing Passport.js. Here’s a snapshot of what a session looks like:\n{\n  &quot;cookie&quot;: {\n    &quot;originalMaxAge&quot;: number,\n    &quot;expires&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\n    &quot;secure&quot;: true,\n    &quot;httpOnly&quot;: false,\n    &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;domain&quot;,\n    &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/&quot;,\n    &quot;sameSite&quot;: false\n  },\n  &quot;passport&quot;: { // Only for logged-in users\n    &quot;user&quot;: // Actual user data here\n  }\n}\nWith that context, we started our investigation. I queried all data in Redis to check the validity of the sessions. Shockingly, only 10% of the sessions contained valid user data! The rest were useless and not required.\nThe Code Unveiled: Why So Many Invalid Sessions?\nI needed to find out how these sessions were being populated. After some digging, I discovered that by default, express-session creates a session for every request that doesn’t have a cookie attached. This means that during the DDoS attack, each request was generating a new session, which was stored in Redis.\nTo prevent this, we needed to set the option saveUninitialized: false. Here’s what that does:\nsaveUninitialized: false // Prevents unmodified sessions from being saved\nFixing the Issue\nAfter making the code change, I also wrote a script to remove the invalid sessions from Redis. You might think that resolved the issue, but the Redis storage continued to increase rapidly.\nThe Investigation Continues\nYou might think we had resolved the issue after our initial code changes. However, as we continued to monitor the Redis database, we noticed that the storage size kept increasing at an alarming rate. Clearly, something was still amiss in our code.\nAfter digging deeper for another day, I discovered we were using the flash package to store temporary messages . This package is useful for sharing messages between server requests using sessions, but it can inadvertently lead to session bloat if not handled carefully.\nHere’s how we were retrieving messages:\nconst { msg } = req.flash();\nWhen I looked into the req.flash() implementation, I found that it assigns an empty object to req.session.flash if it doesn’t already exist:\nvar msgs = this.session.flash = this.session.flash || {};\nThe Problem Unveiled\nThe issue here was that every time we modified req.session, it triggered express-session to store the current session in Redis. This meant that when unauthenticated users were hitting our API—especially during the DDoS attacks—we were creating new sessions unnecessarily. Each request was leading to a new session being stored in our database, further exacerbating the storage problem.\nPath to Resolution\nTo mitigate this, we needed to ensure that we weren’t unintentionally creating sessions for unauthenticated users. I worked on modifying the logic around message retrieval and session handling to prevent this session bloat.\nthis going to be a long detective case so grap a cup coffe to move further\nIt was fine day until this happens where we received DDOS and brute force attack from some random bot IP’s immdentitly we jumped in to that and we started working on stoping that mean while we get another scray alert from redis where it said redis DB is 80%  Fill which make all us to shock becuase most of the time our redis DB will not have go more then 20MB and we have 1GB of storage but we getting alert of 80% full first we want to stop the DDOS and brute force attack to invistigate the redis issue so we added rate limit for the  specific endpoint in cloudfare and then  i started looking on the redis issue\nBefore we dive let me tell what we store on redis we used to store the user session on the redis for authtencation where we used passport js for that if your are nodejs developer you may know how the session will be stored by the passport js like below\n{\n&quot;cookie&quot;: {\n&quot;originalMaxAge&quot;: number,\n&quot;expires&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\n&quot;secure&quot;: true,\n&quot;httpOnly&quot;: false,\n&quot;domain&quot;: &quot;domain&quot;,\n&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/&quot;,\n&quot;sameSite&quot;: false\n},\n&quot;passport&quot;: { //will have for only logged in user\n&quot;user&quot;: //actual user data will be here\n},\n}\n\nSo the valid session will have the user object in the session\nso now you have some idea so we can get started our invistigation first i try to query all the data from and check for how many valid session are exists and and i find only 10% of the session is valid session other dont have user object which mean it is not required for us\nNext i started invistigation how these session are populated in redis that are not valid it does not have passport object i started looked on the code and after some googling i find out that  by default for all request that dont have cookie attached to that request express-session will create session to that request and by default passsport will store that in store (redis db). if we not set the option saveUninitialized: false, which will make sure\nsaveUninitialized\n\nForces a session that is &quot;uninitialized&quot; to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing `false` is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing `false` will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.\n\n\nso you may find out why the redis get 80% full becuase of the DDOS and brute force attack where each request does not have cookie so express session  created session for all request and passport stored that in our Redis db\nso i first  changed the code and pushed and write a script that will remove the invaild session from redis db\nso you may think issue has been resolved even though after did the code change we continously monitor the redis db storage size it keep increasing but fast as before so still some thing wrong in our code so started looking again for  a day and find out that we have using flash pkg\nwhich will use session for storing any msg and it will be usefull if we want to share msg between two server in session\nSo in that to retrive the msg we have passed we have written a code like below\nconst {msg} = req.flash()\nso i checked inside code of req.flash where they doing in where they assing the empty object to req.session.flash if it req.session.flash is don’t have any value as it below\nvar msgs = this.session.flash = this.session.flash || {};\nSo the problem was we altering the this.session which will trigger the express-session to store the current session in db.  so when ever unauth user hitting or doing DDOS on the API we are storing creating new session and storing on our db\nthat what make our DB to fill fast so to fix that once we read the msg i destroyed the session as  below if the session is not valid\nreq.session.destroy();\nfinally we rolled out the changes and it get fixed"},"post/2024/Sherlock-Holmes-and-The-Case-of-the-App-Not-Found":{"title":"Sherlock Holmes and The Case of the App Not Found","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to our Sherlock Holmes-inspired tech adventure Series! Imagine each technical challenge as a thrilling mystery waiting to be solved. Like Sherlock Holmes with his sharp eye for detail, I’ll tackle the problem with wit and precision. Let’s dive in and crack these cases together!\nSetting Up Nginx as a Proxy\nWe recently worked on proxying requests to our Heroku app through Nginx. The Nginx configuration was set up as follows:\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name ourdomain;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass heroku-app.herokuapp.com;\n        \n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n}\n\nAfter configuring Nginx, we restarted the server and updated the IP address in the domain provider. However, when we tried to access our website using the custom domain, we encountered a “Not Found” page.\nInvestigating the Issue\nAt this point, the debugging process began. First, I reviewed the Nginx configuration by inspecting the file to ensure that there were no errors, but everything appeared to be correct.\nI started to suspect that the issue might be related to whether the correct configuration was being applied to our domain, especially since we had multiple configurations. To confirm, I changed the proxy_pass directive to point to Google’s homepage. After making this change, when I accessed our domain, it successfully redirected to Google, confirming that the correct configuration was being used.\nNext, I tested accessing the Heroku app URL directly to verify whether the app itself was working, and it loaded without any issues.\nThe Breakthrough\nWith no other options, I decided to go over the Nginx configuration again. Upon reviewing the file, I had an important realization: the issue was with the Host\nheader configuration. Here’s the problematic line:\nproxy_set_header Host $host;\n\nIf you’ve used Heroku before, you may know that when you create a new app, Heroku automatically assigns it a subdomain like appname.herokuapp.com. But how does Heroku route requests to the correct app when you hit a *.herokuapp.com URL?\nHeroku uses the Host header to determine which app the request should be routed to. If the Host value does not match any Heroku app or if it’s missing altogether, you’ll receive an “App Not Found” error.\nIn our case, the Host header was set to ourdomain, which meant that when the Heroku router tried to forward the request, it looked for an app associated with ourdomain—which obviously doesn’t exist. That’s why we were seeing the “App Not Found” error.\nThe Fix\nTo resolve the issue, the Host header should be set to the Heroku app’s subdomain (appname.herokuapp.com) instead of the custom domain. Here’s the corrected line:\nproxy_set_header Host heroku-app.herokuapp.com;\n\nBy explicitly setting the Host header to the correct value, Heroku can route the request to the appropriate app, and everything works as expected.\nStay tuned for our next adventure, where we continue to unravel the mysteries of the infrastructure world, one case at a time.

Imagine each technical challenge as a thrilling mystery waiting to be solved. Like Sherlock Holmes with his sharp eye for detail, I’ll tackle the problem with wit and precision. Let’s dive in and crack these cases together!\nThe Case: Cloudflare Gateway Timeout Errors\nWe recently embarked on a journey to migrate our application to Kubernetes. The migration process went smoothly, and we successfully moved the majority of our main application. However, shortly after, our clients started experiencing issues. They reported seeing Cloudflare’s Gateway Timeout error, though the issue seemed to resolve itself upon refreshing.\nInitial Investigation\nGiven that the error message indicated a timeout, it was clear that our application was not responding within the specified time limit. We started our investigation:\n\n\nServer Logs Review: We reviewed the server logs but found no obvious issues. Everything seemed to be running fine, and we couldn’t pinpoint the exact times when users were facing problems due to the randomness of the complaints.\n\n\nCorrelated with Migration: One clear observation was that these issues began occurring right after our migration to Kubernetes. This led us to believe that something related to the Kubernetes setup might be causing the problem.\n\n\nDiscovery and Analysis\nThe breakthrough came when one of our colleagues encountered the same error. We checked the server logs again, and while they appeared normal, a deeper analysis revealed a critical insight:\n\n\nWe had recently pushed code to our live server, which triggered a server restart (or, more specifically, a pod restart in Kubernetes).\n\n\nTo confirm if the restart was the issue, we manually restarted the pod and observed that the error could be reproduced until the server was fully up and running.\n\n\nRoot Cause: Cold Start Time\nOur initial assumption was that Kubernetes would handle the transition smoothly, keeping the old server down only once the new server was up and running. While Kubernetes does handle this, we overlooked one crucial detail: cold start time.\nCold start time refers to the period required for a new container to start up, connect to the database, and be fully operational. During this time, Kubernetes might route requests to the new container before it’s ready, leading to failures and timeouts.\nThe Solution: Kubernetes Probes\nTo address the issue, we delved into Kubernetes features and discovered the concept of Probes. Probes are essential for managing the state of containers and ensuring that they are ready to handle traffic. Kubernetes offers three types of probes:\n\n\nLiveness Probe: This probe indicates whether a container is still running. If the probe fails, Kubernetes will kill and restart the container. It helps catch issues like deadlocks and improves application availability.\n\n\nReadiness Probe: This probe checks whether the application in the container is ready to accept requests. If the probe fails, Kubernetes will remove the pod from the service’s endpoints, preventing traffic from being sent to it. This probe is crucial for handling the cold start issue because it ensures that requests are only sent to containers that are fully up and running.\nNote: If you don’t set a readiness probe, Kubernetes assumes that the application is ready to handle traffic as soon as the container starts. This can lead to request failures during the container’s startup period.\n\n\nStartup Probe: This probe determines whether the application has started. Once the startup probe succeeds, other probes begin to function. If the probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container.\n\n\nImplementing the Solution\nTo resolve our issue, we implemented the Readiness Probe in our Kubernetes configuration. This adjustment ensured that traffic was only directed to containers that were fully operational, thus eliminating the Gateway Timeout errors our clients were experiencing.\nStay tuned for our next adventure, where we continue to unravel the mysteries of the infrastructure world, one case at a time.

Imagine each technical challenge as a thrilling mystery waiting to be solved. Like Sherlock Holmes with his sharp eye for detail, I’ll tackle the problem with wit and precision. Let’s dive in and crack these cases together!\nThe Case: Logstash Unexpectedly Stopping\nIf you’re familiar with the ELK stack—Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana—you know it’s a powerful trio for managing and visualizing log data. Logstash, a key player in this stack, processes and forwards logs to Elasticsearch.\nRecently, we encountered a puzzling issue with Logstash after a we migrated the logstash from old Virtual machine to new Virtual machine. We observed a troubling pattern: Logstash stopped at least once per day. This frequent stoppage triggered alerts and required us to manually restart Logstash each time. The problem appeared to have started immediately after the VM migration.\nInitial Investigation: What Was Causing the Shutdown?\nOur first step was to investigate why Logstash was stopping. Checking the logs, we found the following error message: ERROR - Received SIGTERM. Terminating process. This error indicated that Logstash was receiving a SIGTERM signal from the parent process. In technical terms, SIGTERM is a generic signal used to request program termination.\nSuspecting that high memory or CPU usage might be the culprit, we examined the system metrics. However, everything appeared normal.\nDiscovering the True Culprit: Automatic VM Updates\nOur next clue came from examining the cloud activity logs. We noticed a pattern: Logstash stopped precisely when a security update was applied to the VM. This led us to the realization that the VM was being restarted as part of the update process. Consequently, Logstash was stopping because the VM itself was being restarted.\nThe Solution: Ensuring Logstash’s Resilience\nTo resolve this issue, we needed to ensure that Logstash would automatically restart whenever the VM did. We achieved this by adding Logstash to the systemctl service manager as follow.\n\n\nCreate a Systemd Service File for Logstash: We created a service file for Logstash under /etc/systemd/system/logstash.service. This file contains configuration settings to manage Logstash as a system service.\n\n\nReload Systemd and Enable the Service: We reloaded the systemd configuration and enabled the Logstash service to start automatically on boot.\n\n\nStart the Logstash Service: Finally, we started the Logstash service using systemctl.\n\n\nBy doing so, we configured Logstash to start automatically upon VM restarts, ensuring it would resume its operation without manual intervention.\nStay tuned for our next adventure, where we continue to unravel the mysteries of the infrastructure world, one case at a time.

Today, we tackle a perplexing case involving our trusty web server, Nginx. The problem at hand? A broken website UI after a seemingly simple routing change.\nThe Initial Clue: A Broken UI\nOur journey began with a routine change. We needed to route requests starting with /something to a new server. The Nginx configuration was updated as follows:\nserver {\n    location ~ /something/* {\n        proxy_pass http://newserver;\n    }\n}\nWith the change in place, we restarted Nginx and visited our website, only to find the UI in shambles. This was our first clue that something was amiss.\nThe Investigation Begins: Network Tab Analysis\nLike any good detective, I started my investigation by examining the network tab in the browser’s developer tools. It didn’t take long to spot the problem: a JavaScript file request was failing with a 404 error. The request path looked something like /something/.../jsfile.\nThe Suspects: Nginx Configuration and Regex\nFirst, I suspected our Nginx configuration. Was the regex pattern correct? I double-checked it, ensuring it should route requests starting with /something to the new server. Everything seemed in order, but the 404 errors persisted.\nHere, I noticed an odd pattern: while some paths starting with /something were correctly proxied to the new server, the JavaScript file request was still being served from the default server.\nThe Breakthrough: A Clue from Cloudflare\nThe investigation took a new turn when I remembered that we use Cloudflare. Could it be that Cloudflare was caching the old server’s responses? To test this theory, I examined the response headers of the failing requests and found that they were indeed being served from Cloudflare’s cache. (X-Cache: Hit from cloudfront)\nThe Solution: Purging the Cache\nWith the culprit identified, the solution was straightforward: purge the cache on Cloudflare. Once the cache was cleared, the requests were correctly routed to the new server, and the website UI was restored to its former glory.\nThe Conclusion\nThis case taught us the importance of considering caching layers when troubleshooting routing issues. A seemingly perfect server configuration can be undermined by an overlooked cache.\nStay tuned for the next adventure in our Sherlock Holmes series, where we continue to unearth and solve the mysteries."},"post/2024/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Mystery-of-the-Missing-Cookies":{"title":"Sherlock Holmes and the Mystery of the Missing Cookies","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to our Sherlock Holmes-inspired tech adventure Series!

Let’s dive in and crack these cases together!\nCase File: Migration to K8\nOur mission began with migrating a test application from Heroku to Kubernetes (K8). The plan seemed straightforward, but soon we hit a snag. After migrating the test application, I attempted to log in, only to be redirected back to the login page. Oddly enough, the same application worked flawlessly on Heroku. Clearly, something was amiss in the K8 migration.\nClues from Authentication\nyou’re probably familiar with how authentication works. Here’s a quick refresher:\n\nCredentials Submission: You enter your credentials.\nBackend Validation: The server validates your credentials.\nCookie Handling: If all’s good, the server sends cookies to your browser. Your browser then stores these cookies and uses them for subsequent requests.\n\nWith this in mind, I took a closer look at the login endpoint using the network tab. My first clue was that the set-cookie header was missing from the response, despite entering the correct credentials. This seemed suspicious. Could something specific to K8 be causing this issue.\nInvestigating the Middleware\nI started by checking if there were any proxies involved, but there were none. My next move was to add logs to the login endpoint to confirm if the server was sending the set-cookie header. The goal was to determine if something in between was stripping out this header.\nOnce the logs were in place, it became clear that the server wasn’t generating the set-cookie header, even though the credentials were valid.\nDelving into the Code\nTo get to the bottom of this, I dug into the code where we were using Node.js along with Passport and Express-session for authentication. I focused on how set-cookie is handled. Specifically, I examined the Passport.js and Express-session libraries. Here’s the critical snippet I found:\n// only send secure cookies via https\nif (req.session.cookie.secure &amp;&amp; !issecure(req, trustProxy)) {\n    debug(&#039;not secured&#039;);\n    return;\n}\nif (!touched) {\n    // touch session\n    req.session.touch();\n    touched = true;\n} \n// set cookie\nsetcookie(res, name, req.sessionID, secrets[0],req.session.cookie.data);\nAha Moment! Did you spot the issue? The problem became clear: The secure flag was set to true during the initialization of Express-session. This flag ensures that cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections. However, in our K8 setup, we were using HTTP internally, with Nginx handling HTTPS termination. This setup meant that by the time Nginx communicated with our test server, it was over HTTP, which led to the absence of the set-cookie header.\nSolving the Case\nThe solution was to switch from Nginx to Ingress for handling HTTPS. Ingress seamlessly manages HTTPS, solving our issue. Once the change was made, our application began to work perfectly.\nStay tuned for our next adventure, where we continue to unravel the mysteries of the infrastructure world, one case at a time.

My instincts told me it was spam, but my curiosity got the best of me. I clicked the link, and that’s when the adventure began!\nThe Bait: A Tempting Offer\nThe link led me to a flashy website claiming, “Register and Get Up to $15,000 Free Cash Prize Bonus.” It even auto-filled my mobile number, which immediately raised my suspicions, but I decided to keep going. I clicked “Confirm” and soon received an OTP (One-Time Password).\nAfter entering the OTP, I was greeted with a bunch of gift boxes, prompting me to pick one. When I clicked “Activate Now,” I was redirected to a well-known Indian gambling app’s installation page. The scam was starting to come together.\nTime to Investigate\nWith my developer hat on, I knew I had to dig deeper. I revisited the website and inspected the code, and here’s where it got interesting: the code looked like it was generated by ChatGPT! They hadn’t even removed the comments. Even more shocking? The OTP was hardcoded as 456398, which was the exact number I received. They were sending the same OTP to everyone!\nBehind the Curtain\nNext, I checked where the site was hosted and found it was on AWS. Then, I took a look at the network requests to see how they were triggering the OTP. The request payload looked like this:\n {\n\t&quot;number&quot;: mobile number,\n\t&quot;sms&quot;: &quot;1&quot;\n}\n\nChasing the Money Trail\nCurious about how they planned to make money, I researched the gambling app I was redirected to and discovered they had an affiliate program. This means the scammers earn money every time someone installs and plays the game using their referral link. A classic exploitation tactic!\nA Bit of Payback\nWith all this information in hand, I couldn’t just let it go. I noticed they had an endpoint that allowed sending OTP to any phone number, which sparked an idea. I figured I could send random valid phone numbers to their service—maybe even overload their system a bit. which defently going to cause some amount of money for them\nSo, I opened up ChatGPT (not my code editor!) and asked it to help me write a script that would send requests with randomly generated phone numbers. I capped it at around 5,000 requests to keep things manageable. It felt like just the right amount of payback without going overboard.\nIt was fine firday where i fixing our user issue and i got a below message\nwhich trigger my attention and i know it will defentiely a spam message but my curosity tell me let see how they try to spam us so i clicked the link and it take be the below website where it asking Register and get upto 15K free cash prize bouns and where they passed by mobile number and auto fill and then i clicked  click confirm  and i recevied the OTP\nI entered the OTP and where they have lot of gift box and where i need to press any one after press i get the below message\nwhen i clicked the activate now i get redirect to playstore webapp page and it the page famous indian gammling game app installation page\nSo now i have clarity of what they doing so now it time bring my developer brain to invsitigate how they doing this and why they doing this so get ready for invistigation\ni revisted the website again and inspecte the code and find this funny thing\nYou may guessed the code was genrated by chatGPT :joy   and who doing this scam who even not removed the comments  and if you noticed they have hardcoded value of OTP as 456398 and that same number i recieved so they sending same OTP to everyone\nNext i checked the hosting details and i find out that it was hosted on AWS,\nNext i inspected the network tab to check the endpoint that calling to trigger the OTP where they sending the number and sms count 1 as form data like below\n {\n\t&quot;number&quot;: mobile number,\n\t&quot;sms&quot;: &quot;1&quot;\n}\n\nNext i started invistgate of how they will going get money. i did some research about the famous gabbling app where it redirected me and i find out they providing the affliate program where they give some amount of money if the user have installed and played the game by using the referal link\nOk the invistigation is over now it time to take revenge if you noticied one thing they have endpoint where we can send any phone number  where they defentlye using some service to send SMS so i do DDOS with random valid phone numbers defenlty there bill going to raise and defently it teach them a good leason. so i opened the chatgpt (not code editor) and asked to write a script that will post request with random genreated phone numbers and start hitting the website\nbasically i dont want to do more damage to them so i stop among 5k request may be less but i feel like to stop"},"post/2024/The-Day-a-DDOS-Attack-Led-to-the-Most-Awkward-Hello-World":{"title":"The Day a DDOS Attack Led to the Most Awkward Hello World","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hey everyone, grab a coffee because I’ve got a funny (and slightly embarrassing) story to share!

Spoiler: it was all caused by a single typo in Meilisearch’s documentation. 🙃\nWe’ve been using Meilisearch to enhance our product’s search functionality, and recently, we got a new requirement: We needed to trigger some business logic every time Meilisearch completed indexing.\nAfter exploring Meilisearch’s features, we stumbled upon something that seemed like the perfect solution—task webhooks. This feature allows you to get notified when an indexing task is completed, exactly what we needed!\nAccording to the official docs, all we had to do was set up two environment variables: one for the webhook URL and another for the authorization header.\nSo, we set it up as per the documentation, started indexing some data, and patiently waited for the webhook to trigger. 🎉 It did! But… our business logic didn’t execute as expected. 😕\nWe checked the server logs to ensure the webhook was triggering, and it was. But something wasn’t right—our business logic still wasn’t running. When we dug into the logs, we found that our server was returning a 401 status code. Uh-oh! 😟\nNaturally, we thought we messed something up on our server’s side, particularly with the webhook authorization header validation. We double-checked our Meilisearch environment setup—everything looked fine. So, we decided to log the incoming request headers to see if the auth header was even being passed correctly.\nTo our surprise, it was completely empty. 😅\nAt this point, it became clear that the issue wasn’t on our side. After a lot of Googling, reading forums, and countless debugging attempts, we still couldn’t crack it.\nFinally, I decided to take matters into my own hands and dive into Meilisearch’s codebase. I wanted to see exactly how they were sending the webhook event and attaching the authorization header.\nAnd that’s when I discovered the culprit: a simple typo in their documentation. 🤦‍♂️\nIn the code, they were using the environment variable MEILI_TASK_WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER, but the docs listed it as MEILI_TASK_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER. They’d accidentally left out the “WEBHOOK” part!\nOnce we corrected the typo in our environment variable, everything worked like a charm. 🛠️\nFeeling like a true detective, I didn’t stop there. I went ahead and submitted a pull request to fix the typo in their documentation so that future developers wouldn’t have to go through the same ordeal. The PR got merged, and for a brief moment, I felt like a superhero, saving other developers’ precious time."}}
